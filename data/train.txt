I have the 12pro max and literally only getting the IP14 Pro model because Im tired of the max size.  So really nothing on the 14 pro model that wows me.

Some people are just too sue happy. Hurt feelings from people stating opinions don't count, Bro! He definitely stepped wrong on this, because now someone like me, who has zero interest in crypto because of excessive cynicism, knows about him and knows to steer clear.

We are a absolute mess. If Casemiro was the target why wasn't he signed 2 months ago?. We just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man. Im not saying Casemiro is a rubbish player, he is quality. Its just Man Utd's approach to signings is a joke. Plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week. ( but ill literally take anything over Scott and Fred ).	0

Half the comments on this video are lol you guys think the SAT is hard wait til you learn about (insert random countrys standardized test).

I like her approach and It's partly right but I do believe that the things that we want to do during the week could be postponed for other reasons too and not only because we don't count them as priorities. For example,  it's not the same having free time in the morning and having free time at 23:00. The opportunities for doing certain things are less (kids are in bed, shops are closed etc.) Also, when you want to meet other people you need to find some hours in which you are both free and it's not super easy to happen	1

"I'm not convinced that opting out of Google's security ""features"" does anything. I've noticed with its phone tracking system that if I turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month, I can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month, when it was off. I think that they still track you, and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it, and I believe this is also the case for other security features. For this and other reasons, I've been working on weaning myself off of Google services for the last year or so."	0

"We are teaching our children the wrong things in school. We are creating a societal system where each section is dependent upon the other sections. This means when one section fails then the rest also fail. 

We need to teach our children to be independent.  Instead, we teach children how to be obedient workers.

To give meaning to someone's life teach them how to grow their own food, build their own house, repair their own car, cook their own meals, eat to stay healthy and most importantly how to meditate and pray. This gives life meaning."	0

Quality player is Casemiro & also a DM which we've cried out for. The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid? We are said to pay him an eye-popping 400k a week is what I've heard & that's typical United, one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable, unmotivated players who we then can't move on when it's time. As I say, quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but won't helps us achieve anything substantial. As for Pulisic, I've always been quite underwhelmed by him, albeit you can see he does possess good quality. I probably wouldn't be averse to a loan though, it can't be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping Rashford does anything productive every week.	0

Nice beds.  If you like the bed sheets to look crisp, like they were just ironed, make the bed and then lightly mist spray the sheets (including the pillowcases) with plain water, using a standard spray bottle.

Does anyone have a love-hate relationship with analyzing literature? Like, when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something, it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion. But, when I try to find a meaning of something, it always turns out to be wrong even though theres technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly. It just doesnt make sense to me when I would get a 75 on a analysis paper just because the teacher didnt see/analyze what I wrote about a certain text.	0

"You did a great job introducing the ""how to learn"" aspect of what I think stumps a lot of intimidated curious learners. Basically, when you explained ""When I saw this I didn't know what it meant, so I googled it."" That is crazily enough, a big lesson to learn.  Just hearing that at least is encouraging me to take my first independent steps to learning this stuff.  So of course, thanks for the video!"	2

My (Ukrainian) gran fought at Stalingrad on the Soviet side. She had to decode messages to be sent to headquarters in Moscow. Whilst in service, she personally witnessed the surrender of General von Paulus. She also told me that most of the prisoners she saw there were Romanians and Italians as opposed to Germans. God bless her soul: she left us back in 2017 and would be 100 next August.	1

I own a series S. Bought it when the X was impossible to find last year and honestly it runs great. Yet to see how next gen gaming truly performs on this thing but I haven't had a single issue with the machine. Load times are waaayy faster than the xbox one s and PS4. Looks great on my 1440p monitor and when upscaling on 4k tv's. Gamepass is great. The hard drive is a bit small for holding s/x optimized games. I use an external for everything else. Stick to performance mode and you will not have any frame rate issues. Lastly, it fits in my backpack if I travel with it. This thing is worth every penny imo.	2

"I usually pick up a book for two reasons, either because I like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality (and that is why I read a lot of fantasy and horror) or because I want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time (for that is when I go to classics and more international literature). Also I totally agree with the ""people should read classics"" thing, it's so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations."	2
You're so cool. I really look up to you because you're so smart. I really wanted to learn stoichiometry but I couldn't and I had trouble picking it up but thanks to you I have easily learned it!

I love that as  part of additional recourses for our sociology class we have these videos. It is also funny how our teacher is always warning us that it's focused a lot on american context. :D Which is true, because from this video it looks like USA has one of the best educational systems, which is deffinetly not true. Here in the Czech Republic compulsory school attendance functions since 1774. Also our entire educational system is free and there is no religon in most schools (public or private). Of course there are many countries that have worse educational system than USA, but I don't think you have the best one. But it's just my opinion, so please don't come at me... :D	2
Thanks for the insight	2
"Nice collection. My cube collection is something like this:

So I started out with a rubik's speed 3x3 (when they were decent for beginners and not louder than an f1 car) but it didn't last very long (I corner cut too much and the entire thing exploded, and some of the pieces went missing)

Then for christmas I got a QiYi megaminx that I still haven't learned how to solve

Then my friend gave me a tiled rubik's 3x3. this was the cube that I leaned to solve on

Then I got a MoYu WeiLong WR (I'm getting an SCS Corner-Edge magnet set and a corner-core magnet set you can get from the cubicle). its a good cube. and until christmas it will probably be my main and depending it my stay as my main longer than that"	1

Let's perform it on a positive note. The culture and ecology have to be healthy for starters. Schools have to be safe and secure. It has to be supportive of learning curve for the students. The student must take extreme ownership of the curricula. The subject matters must be based on science. Learning methods must be evidence-based. (Yes, I'm a seasoned STEM teacher by the way).	2
"Here is my feedback:

-I totally got the eureka moments in every level
-It will be easier to automatically grab de magnet
-I got softlocked many times so the restart was nice. I dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset
-Initially I thought I should return to the key hub, that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic
-I'll love to move while aiming, it feels more fluent
 -The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I don't know how well it fits in the game. The doors weren't like the key type so it doesn't make sense to open them with it, also it's kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe... maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better
-Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character, for example making the positive smile and the negative sad
-The main character could shine more while aiming, maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim

Overall I loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so I could try it ?"	2

"Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said ""I got bored with the game"".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  

I teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.

I met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.

I also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and ""The Play"" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.

My own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.

Our team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many ""crazy"" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.

Even in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.

On my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane. ??"	2

Great video Shane! Completely Nailed it. As a data scientist myself, I was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were.  On the job, a lot of my peers find that they aren't challenged enough by their positions. This is probably because data science is still relatively new, and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams. The other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they aren't liking the position at hand. I love seeing the data and trying to map it to what I'm hearing anecdotally!	2
I've had varying work schedules and it was incredibly hard to adjust to night shifts at first mainly because it was hard to find time to hang out with friends and family.

The whole crux is that these things are just merely tools to solve research problems in other domains and thus making computational easier. Just like a bridge which connects two islands. Most people do not understand this logic and hence go forward in this career because it is in ''demand"". You have demystified many myths via this video ??.

We did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences, but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching, ie try and give the children a verbal aspect, and an auditory aspect, and a reading aspect, and a kinaesthetic aspect. That sounds more like the multi-modal approach you described. I remember I came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well.

"Dickens's genius was in bringing characters, and physical objects to life. He was not being ""seductive"" he was making us relive his experience and making  people and places come to life. No one will ever forget Miss Havisham's wedding cake, the character of Bill Sykes, or Mr Micawber. Once you encounter the scenes and objects and characters of his novels you never forget them."	2

Daemon Targaryen aka the Rogue Prince is the best Targaryen in the lore of ASOIAF, and I can't wait for yah to see more of him. An we all should take some time to praise Matt Smith for his portrayal of the character, because it's nothing short of perfection.

"I've had both iPhone and Android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iPhone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest iOS on every device. The only company that can use iOS is also Apple, so there's not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which Android device is best. Additionally, Apple may be ""late to the party"" with certain things, but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know it's going to work significantly better than the competition. Apple may be more costly, but I'd rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway."	2

"While the Steam Deck's performance handling these AAA games is impressive I'd really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects. The Steam Deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try PC gaming and it really has so much more to offer.
Where I feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known, smaller, and past titles.
(Basically pick any random, old, game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rerelease/remaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console. Older games often look much better on smaller screens too. So many should be fantastic on that little thing.)"	2

This is an original composed version of Ave Maria by Igor Krutoy per Dimash's request. It does share some similarities with the Caccini composition and might have been the inspiration.
Some have posited that because Igor is Jewish and Dimash is Muslim, they may have opted to forego the lyrics for this reason, which would make sense. Again, I don't believe that has been confirmed by either one."	1

"In my experience, burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesn't produce improved rewards, it produces more work. The response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus, instead good work is ""rewarded"" with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time. Firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all it's worth, young people are almost never treated as the company's future."	0

Just a reminder: for older motherboards or cost-cut motherboards, if you have a CPU with iGPU or onboard graphics solution, even if you have a graphics card there is a good chance that it will default to the motherboard's graphics solution first and you will need to configure the BIOS to use the external graphics for pre-boot display. This has become less common, but is still important to remember.	1

What nobody is talking about is, The leads.  When a search warrant is presented to a judge, the affiant explains exactly what theyre looking for and where to find it.

"I bought an old tractor to help clear the land I was building on. ""Stick with me."" 
I was towing a large log when I felt the back of my leg getting wet. No problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness. Turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires (tyres) 
Apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres (tires) with water to improve traction due to the added weight. Maybe sealant would be a better idea. Expensive though.
Love the show guys"	2
Amazing documentary. Things like this always blows my mind and enables me to think widely. And at the end of a topic when I learn something new and astonishing I cant help but smile bcs these are so amusing. Also huge respect to the scientists who are able to think and invent and see the world is such different perspectives. They inspire me a lot	2

"Me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Beb soy

Entonces, ?qu intentas hacerme?
Es como si no pudiramos parar, somos enemigos
Pero nos llevamos bien cuando estoy dentro de ti
Eres como una droga que me esta matando
Te cort por completo
Pero me pongo tan alto cuando estoy dentro de ti

S, puedes empezar de nuevo, puedes correr libre
Puedes encontrar otros peces en el mar.
Puedes fingir que est destinado a ser
Pero no puedes alejarte de mi

Todava puedo orte hacer ese sonido
Tirndome rodando por el suelo
Puedes fingir que fui yo pero no

Beb, me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Beb soy

Entonces si corro no es suficiente
Sigues en mi cabeza
Siempre atascado
Para que puedas hacer lo que quieras hacer
Amo tus mentiras, me las comer
Pero no niegues al animal
Que cobra vida cuando estoy dentro de ti

S, puedes empezar de nuevo, puedes correr libre
Puedes encontrar otros peces en el mar.
Puedes fingir que est destinado a ser
Pero no puedes alejarte de mi

Todava puedo orte hacer ese sonido
Tirndome rodando por el suelo
Puedes fingir que fui yo pero no

Beb, me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Beb soy

No digas mentiras, no puedes negar
La bestia dentro, si, si, si
No chica, no mientas, no puedes negar
La bestia dentro, si, si, si
Woah woah woah
Como animales

Beb, me estoy aprovechando de ti esta noche
Cazarte, comerte vivo
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Tal vez pienses que puedes esconderte
Puedo oler tu esencia desde millas
Como animales, animales
Como animales-mals
Beb soy

No digas mentiras, no puedes negar

The real amazing thing about Ems first few lines is that he was finishing Young MAs rhyme scheme that she started way back in her verse. She rhymes Quavo, facial, Lay Lo, Wayne mode, drake mode, rake mode, paid so, gang mode, pain go, flame go, etc (its out of order I know) and then Em comes in Game O(ever), Thanos and finished it. The man is a monster but that was nothing but respect to Young MA for holding the rhyme scheme out that long, which I think was something she did to pay homage to Em cause thats his style. Fire song.	2

Hey man, I just started my Computer science journey at UCF about a month ago and I was wondering if you ever found a specific time during the day or night where you find yourself to be the most efficient with coding. In other words do you have a time during the day where you just shut everything down and force yourself to just stop programming for the day or is it usually different for you every day? I loved this video I really related to feeling pretty lost my first 2 weeks as I had no programming experience at all but am finally really starting to get the hang of things. My professor for my Intro to C class has been constantly repeating that 80% of the learning in this class will be outside of the classroom and I have found that to be some real truth.	2

I subbed to this amazing channel back when it had just 60k subs. I have been here since almost a year now. Time flies by for sure. 
I don't have a lot to say about this video since it's pretty technical. I'm not really a huge fan of trucks. I will say, however, that I want you guys to get back to this guy and see how he's doing in a couple years. This guy definitely thinks big and I love that. He is such a huge inspiration. I have started my affiliate marketing and already made $7k in just 6 months. It's nothing compared to the amount of money he makes, but we will get there for sure. 
Kudos to you guys again. You are doing such an amazing job. Can you please make the vending machine video (I believe you made one) go live? I would love that. Thanks.

Excellent explanation. I completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against Eurocentrism, but I think its scope is even bigger. One aspect of magic realism is politically ideological, that is the postcolonial stuff. Another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialistic/scientific determinism. This aspect is more philosophical, and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical i.e. it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes. This is just my personal opinion.	2

Nuclear is a great carbon-free base load electricity source. Id like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio. On the downside, nuclear is expensive to build and insure, but the actual watts  generated are among the cheapest. There are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors, and it seems like well have enough of it for 50-100 years if we generate 40-50% of the energy from nuclear. On top of that, thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts. Another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors (4th gen) which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run, making initial investment lower. They would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid.	1

I'd like to see a panel of security experts -- gov't officials intimately familiar with Standards for handling TS/SCI, such as the ICS-705-1 and the like. Anyone who has held a cleared position in DoD is familiar with the mandatory security training they had to take every year and probably remembers the many references to the DoDM 5105.21, ICS, and other standards. I think the public needs to hear first hand -- officially -- how this material was supposed to be taken care of; they need to hear about SCIFs, combo safes, cypher locks, cover sheets, security procedures, and all the penalties associated with mishandling such material. This is not a political discussion; it's a national security matter.	1

"I remember two years ago staying up at 3 in the morning with a cup of anxiety, just to listen to the 3 AM Study Session premiere at 144p using limited data on my half cracked phone, wondering where I'll be in the future and if things will go well for me after I graduate.

Now here I am once again at 3 in the morning with a cup of coffee, fast internet, and my own custom PC. It took a lot to get here and I still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future. But for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years, just know that if I could make it, than so can you. I hope you will get to experience the same bliss I have at the moment. As we often forget to enjoy just today, when we keep thinking about the tomorrows

I've never watched the movie, but the book 12 Years a Slave was so descript and disturbing! Although there were times I had to put the book down, I really like how it brought much more light to the tortures and horrendous practices performed by the YT man AND the YT woman. Textbooks in high school never went into the details of physical and mental punishments. All I was ever taught about was whippings, beatings, and a little about the rapings. But there was so much more that only an inhumane brute could think of doing. Solomon Northup described them a lot as demoniac, being possessed with an evil spirit, and soulless #seedofesau	0

"It looks like they might be simplifying their phone line - by differentiating the Regular and Pro lines:
 - iPhone 14 / 14 Max - effectively last year's phones (same design, CPU, screen) will become budget phones at $600 - 700, replacing all the different old models (SE, Xr, 11, 12) they keep around to sell as budget phones
 - iPhone 14 Pro / 14 Pro Max -  will be the actual flagship phones at $1100 - 1300
Otherwise it does not make sense for Apple to downgrade the regular iPhone 14 so much.
Which is a good thing, because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models, sizes - now they'll just have regular 14 (effectively last years models) and 14 Pro (the flagship models). 
They should simplify the iPad line as well."	2

the fact that Sigurd mentions a way to an alpha-verse (with alpha usually meaning first) kinda reinforces the idea that were in the universe where Cereza wasnt sealed away, and the climax of the story could probably involve our main Bayonetta because its confirmed were gonna meet other Bayonettas. this also kinda ties into how Hellena Taylor tweeted about getting used to not hearing her iconic voice, which could mean the kinda low and seductive one she uses for our main Bayo.	1

"I never really agreed with this kind of education system. I live in Malaysia. My earliest childhood memories were ever only filled with tuitions left and right, no play until you finish your homework, if you fail to memorise spellings you will be punished.

Back then I never really thought much of it. But now that Im in college, being exposed to a more western type of education system made me question this kind of practice. It never helpd me improve my academic. I was always dead last in class. All it ever did to me was lowering my self confidence and give me anxiety. I'm never going back to those times."	0

And like visual scripting vs actual coding, being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldnt be able to do with visual scripting a shader.	2

"If you want a role where you want to work only with AI and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job, if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ML and analyze data go for a data scientist job. 

Working as a ML engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code (so it's more SE from one side), you use python for model development and c++/java for production (the role is building AI products, so you are all day reviewing, extracting and preprocessing data to then training ML models, evaluate them and match required KPIs)

In the other hand, data scientists positions offer what is described in the video: statistics and data preparation (engineering) and classic ML, there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages, and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have

For example, In ML engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve, in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change. Both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes

I have been in both, my background is in statistics and I have been working as ML engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years. Personally, I can say ML engineering is more fun, even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy AI methods"	1

I just finished watching a documentary by a famous British historian about how people could possibly have been caught up in the Nazi regime. The documentary seemed relevant to this. This historian pointed out that each and every one of us likes to imagine that if we had been present at some dark moment in history, we would have been the ones to stand up, think independently and rebel. And yet, almost no one (if anyone at all) did this at these times. If you have grown up with everyone around you--parents, mentors, peers, teachers, leaders--all thinking one way, it takes a very rare individual to have a conscience of his own. It seems that in a very significant way, we are all defined by the circumstances into which we are born. Whatever your folks tell you and raise you to think, that is what you will be for the rest of your life. Unless you are one out of a million. From what this guy says, it is no surprise at all that he became what he became. We can never excuse terrible crimes, but we can try to understand them.	1

"Preparing for interviews can be arduous because like you pointed out that different organisations have different definitions of a Data Scientist role and Data Science is such an extremely broad term that is often times disputed amongst people. You only find out when you sit for the interviews that the organisations sometimes are actually looking for a Data Analyst or ML Engineer or Data Engineer when the interview doesn't circle around what you'd imagine it to be. But that's the reality and thanks for pointing it out.

And most of the time I am just scraping and cleaning the data which definitely gives me mixed feelings about my job role. I could really relate to your experiences and it definitely resonated with me. Such an insightful video for the ones who want to pursue their career in Data Science because often times it can be misinterpreted."	1

Fun fact on that last question: a good 80-90% of the foods we refer to as 'vegetables' are actually fruits, there are actually not that many edible 'vegetable' kind of plants. The reason these fruits are called 'vegetables' is a result of culinary distinction rather than a biological one, labelling the plant by its use in dishes rather than what it is categorically.	1

Id love this as a video game. Create a Skyrim-esque world except where dragons arent mythical creatures but wild animals that could have adequate intelligence and small levels of society (like a smart dolphin).

The detail and thoughtfulness some of these people put into their packaging is just insane. Obviously, whether the product itself is actually good is another matter, but just the sheer creativity, beauty and detail in the presentation would probably make me wanna order from them again even if the product itself wasn't anything super special. That kind of packaging makes receiving the product an ~experience~, like getting an incredible, delightful present. I would be smiling like crazy and squealing with delight as soon as I open a box like that, would probably make my whole week. These people are so cool and I admire and respect them so much	2
Those first couple minutes made me feel like I jumped into the kool-aid without knowing the flavor. Then they kissed and I was oooooh ok we're lemonade mixed with saddness and betrayal. ??????	0
"This made me google ""judge vs. magistrate judge.""  The response most suited to my question read:  ""Generally, both judges and magistrates have the same general authority when it comes to hearing your case, ruling on objections, and determining the outcome; however, a judge has more power than a magistrate. Also, appealing the decision of a magistrate and a judge illicit different processes as well.""  Further reading of google blurbs revealed that magistrates can only decide civil cases.  They can handle pre-trial issues in criminal cases, but they are not the last word, the ultimate decision maker, in criminal cases.
Any knowledgeable lawyers or judges, out there, please respond whether this is correct.  Thank you."	1

"The Sumerians were beautiful artisans! Ive seen Queen Puabis artifacts at an exhibit in the Penn Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and they really stuck with me. Before you said Puabis name, I already felt the footage you were showing looked familiar. That doesnt happen to me too often with historical societies (and I go to a lot of anthropological museums), really a testament to how strong of an impression seeing their crafts will leave on you! 

I really recommend anyone who is able to, go visit the Penn Museum. The exhibit on Queen Puabi and her people is pretty extensive! The jewelry especially is so ornate and finely smithed, its amazing to think how long ago people were already incredibly skilled in making beautiful things."	2

"Since I was little I knew Id rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do. Having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5% increase every year just sounds insane to me. I studied software engineering so I could build my own tools and sell them. Took countless 70+ hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup. Currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries Im interested in.

3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this Liverpool team but, the early indications are that the Liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources. As a long time LFC supporter I can't help but compare the decision to let Sadio Mane go to the same situation with Xavi Alonso some years back. I think that J. Klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year. Hope I am wrong but, if I am being honest Man. Utd should have been 4-0 up at halftime.	0

This is lovely to hear how you found a whole community and amazing that you spent so long persistently making stuff, especially over a year of daily art. I just discovered Core, but didnt realise its a creation tool, I havent loaded it up yet and they described it more as an arcade full of games. Ive had an idea for a cat game for ages since I got three kittens last year and theyre hilarious, I dont suppose theres a basic cat model to edit. I draw and paint some, but the oomph goes too easily, I just got back into gaming after a while and you saying I was a bored artist resonated. Ive been wanting to do more with characters I was writing a story for too, heck I even learned code a few years ago, but my passion for websites waned and I found I didnt love battling all my errors enough to keep going. So this all seems fun ??	2

"Hmm... I'd still go with the Steam Deck. This is more expensive and looks like it performs worse. The only thing going for it is the OLED screen. Plus I think the Steam Deck will last longer, with it's powerful hardware and Valve's continued support. 
Plus I'm not sure how to feel about Aya Neo. They release a new console every 6 months, which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run. And they were WAY too expensive, and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the Steam Deck.

"This was inevitable.  University tuition kept skyrocketing over the past 20 years. Tuition has greatly outpaced both inflation and incomes for college-aged students. 

The entire Millennial generation became de facto indentured servants from their college debt. Basically financial slaves to their debt.

Education can be very useful for employment goals, but there are limits. And we are approaching that limit from a cost to value perspective.

Generation Z is not stupid and they are declining to voluntarily set themselves up for a lifetime of paying back student debt. (Trust me, Gen Z:  you do not want to find yourself in that situation. It will steal years, if not decades, from your life. And you will never get that time back.) 

Also most skills of the high demand and lucrative software engineering tech jobs are not taught in college, but rather can be learned just as easily by anyone with a cheap internet connection and sufficient motovation/focus. 

It's common for software developers to earn 6 figure salaries with no college at all.  Companies do not care where you went to school or even of you went: they only care if you have the skills that can help solve their business problems.  How you go about acquiring those skills is totally irrelevant. The company doesn't care if you learned to program Java at college or on your own.

It's high time that universities start to feel the sting to their annual profits as more 17 and 18 year olds wake up and push back on the cost of attending college."	1

"The reason why #1 works isnt just because of the method, but because in the first case you only have one finger; the center of mass is always a point, and since youve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane, there is effectively a 0% chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point, and thus starts leaning towards one side or another.

If you use the second method, theres two points of contact, and thus as long as the center of mass is in-between, it cannot tilt. You can try finding the center of mass on your own, with two fingers together, without using the special method, and just doing it normally, and youll see it works fine.

TL;DR: You dont need a special method to balance on the center of mass, you just need two fingers so that there are two contact points for the center of mass to be between."	1

Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with Expert MR.

"Hey Robert, I've used Apple products since the 80's, owned since the 90's  I love apple products, but they have left me in a position I never thought I'd be in with them.  My late 2015, 27"" iMac is one of the models to get cut off from macos 13.  That's not a big deal.  What bothers me more is there is no 27"" iMac  with Apple Silicon.  It's been the perfect combination of space saving, and nice big beautiful display.  There current line up is just something I'm not sure what I want.  Mac Mini, or, Mac studio + Apple Pro display may end up costing more than the iMac did to get something equivalent 

I have two years left of security updates for Monterey, which is good.  I'd rather have an older computer that runs well, and meets my needs, than buy something new that I wouldn't enjoy using.
On that note, my AppleTV (s) and iPhone will get the next updates, so will be able to look forward to that."	2

"The question I want answered is how did top secret documents kept in a secure location only to be viewed by someone with the highest security clearance who had to request then be approved and then wait in a skiff for an armed guard to bring said documents where they may be viewed sans any electronic devices and then when finished viewing surrender any notes taken and finally replaced under guard to top secret storage make their way to the trump White House.  Pretty good question.
Then, it begs the question who in the trump administration had the security clearance to get them and how were they removed?

"She Hulk- im better at controlling my anger because I control my anger infinitely more than you.  I control my anger when im catcalled in the street and when toxic men explain my job to me 

Do the writers even know Bruce Banner at all? Or do they just look at him as a man that gets angry and turns green and big. Because that line of dialogue was ridiculous.  Bruce banner was abused as a kid, watched his father figure beat his mom to death.  Bruce tried to off himself and failed.  Bruce has to live with the fact that Hulk took control of his body and mass killed innocent people in Avengers 2.  

Absolute ridiculous writing."	0
"Personally, I think education (or, specifically, a lack thereof) is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this -- because ignorance breeds fear and distrust, especially in things that are new or foreign.

When I was in elementary school, back in the 70's, I was reading my way through my school's sci-fi section. It was just a few shelves, but it had almost all the classics... Asimov, Bova, Bradbury, Campbell, Clarke, Doc Smith, Heinlein -- and then I got to Verne. I'd just finished up 30,000 Leagues and was getting into Journey to the Center of the Earth when I found a page had been ripped from the book.

Being a good student, I reported it to the Librarian... but instead of focusing on the missing page, she was outraged that I was reading this particular book. It was ""above my level"" she said, and ""too difficult"" for me. This was a hundred-year-old story at this point, and I was pretty sure it wasn't a difficult one to follow -- the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on Creature Feature on Saturdays! But she still took the book away... and over the next few weeks, that sci-fi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there.

A short time later, I overheard her talking to another teacher about, of all things, a ""shooting star"" -- a meteor that many had seen a night or two before. The Librarian was mocking the teacher because ""a shooting star is impossible -- the Heavens are permanent! The stars don't move!"" As the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor, it seemed to both terrify and outrage her. And the longer that conversation went on the more even I (maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time?) realized -- the sci-fi books she had removed weren't above MY level, they were above HER level. She had no understanding of science, and all these sci-fi stories about starships, robots, and alien worlds were things that she just didn't understand... and because of that, they scared her, so she locked them away.

And unfortunately, it sounds like that sort of mindset hasn't changed all that much in the 40 or so years since then."	0

"actually, i have a plenty good options for the game.

those options are:
- player has 200 health points
- the turret has a field of view / a.i. (if it sees the player, it'll shoot.)
- health and power pickups
- airborne / aerial targets (such as drones, heavy gunner drones, scout drones, etc.)
- ground targets (such as beam-shooting mechs, enemy balls (similar to the player but a little bit dumb), and laser artilleries.)
- the tank can destroy the turret (since the tank has the same weapons as the turret, but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank.)
- grenade-type weapons and projectiles (i meant by that which has new weapons to choose, such as full-auto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire, or just a single-shot grenade launcher, similar to the M79.)
- the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup :)
- the player can shut down the turret's system

i hope this guy would see this :)"	2
"The minecraft way:
Step 1: Build a 'temporary' box house or cave home
Step 2: After playing for awhile and gathering materials, prepare to build your new house
Step 3: Look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration
Step 4: Realize that to accomplish any of those, you'll need to get 10x the resources you already have and spend like 10 hours of dedicated building time
Step 5: Stop playing for 8 months
Step 6: Start playing again, but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing
Step 7: Decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world
Step 8: Return to step 1"	0

"<High inflation was never a reason to sell<The definition of inflation is that prices go up versus fiat, essentially. Logically, that would make sense even for stocks, but especially for a commodity that's been known for many years as an ""inflation hedge."" My growing love for crypto caused me to explore until I came across Alice Marcella (although I'm trying to avoid sensationalism) Alice is by far the best. No hype for hype's sake, but great inspiration to trade Crypto.
The market has been irrational for far too long. What we're seeing today is a small correction of the illogical selling pressure."	2

Scott, I'm becoming a skeptic of your show. It's interesting but not much gets solved, and some of it is pretty far fetched. You didn't even convince the guy at the lab on this one.

"Respect for teachers is not just about the salary -- although an increase in salary is sorely needed. Teacher pay has always been lower than other professions with the same education and experience. It's also about respect for the profession. Student behavior, in my view, can be linked to the disrespect for teachers they're seeing parents, administrators, and politicians demonstrate. Hiring a person trained as a soldier to teach is VERY disrespectful to the profession. As a teacher, I don't feel qualified to do the job of a soldier; i respect the profession too much. The ""anybody can teach"" attitude is not only insulting, it's ignorant."	0
"In the '80's, I used a different strategy to solve this problem, just for my satisfaction.

A short program with less than 100 lines of code was enough to get satisfactory results.

"Hi everyone, exactly a week ago, we conducted a contest in this video. The answer to the question is given below:
The correct order of working for Neural Network with explanation: 
B. The weighted sum of inputs is calculated
A. The Bias is added
D. The result is fed to an activation function
C. Specific Neuron is activated

Explanation: In a neural network, each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers. These connections carry random weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated, and an additional input in the form of bias is added (w * x + b). The result of this is fed to an activation function. Based on a particular threshold value, only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value.

We are pleased to announce the 3 lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz:
1. Divya Maskar
2. Kartik Singhal
3. Michael Ipinolu
Congratulations to all the winners! They've won an Amazon voucher worth INR 500."	1

< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with *WTRADE INSPECTS* , in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.	1

Here is my story: Im currently thirteen years old and have been programming for a year. I started off with the basics of C for a few months, then I moved on to Python (Im currently a Python intermediate) and now I started learning Java. I think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects. I was fascinated by the cool games and projects I can create, and that made programming even more enjoyable to me. I would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club (as suggested in this video) because you can help each other out and build projects together. I personally wasnt able to find a coding partner of a coding club since not many kids my age know how to code.	2

"I've worked for about 2 years with ML/computer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated. When I started out I was frustrated that I couldn't dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but I realized there are a lot of ""boring"" things that need to be in place before that's even relevant (data curation, annotation, testing frameworks etc just to name a few). There are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that I probably wouldn't even realize existed if I stayed in academia for a PhD. 

I think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning ""tools for the sake of tools"" and solving problems though. As long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh"	2

I will say Bruce seems unbelievably upbeat through everything he's been though from his childhood to the end of the infinity saga, but I'm glad to see him less awkward and more confident in himself :)

"Since the animations are kinda confusing the numbers up, I recapped the transformation here:

*Glycolysis*

Glucose + 2 ATP >> 2 Pyruvates + Energy.
This energy is used for making 4 ATP (net profit of 2 ATP) and 2 NADH from 2 ADP, 2 NAD+ and 2 hydrogen (probably H+).

*Fermentation*

Pyruvate >> Energy + Lactic Acid.

*Krebs Cycle*

2 Pyruvates + 2 O? >> 2 Acetyl Coenzyme A + 2 CO? + Energy.
This energy is used to form 2 NADH from NAD+ and hydrogen.
2 Acetyl Coenzyme A + 2 Oxaloacetic Acid >> 2 Citric Acid.
2 Citric Acid + 4 O? >> 2 Oxaloacetic Acid + Energy + 4 CO?.
This energy is used to make 2 ATP, 6 NADH and 2 FADH?.
So after the Krebs Cycle we now have 10 NADH, 2 FADH? and 4 ATP (or 6 if you count the ATP spent in Glycolysis).

*Electron Transport Chain*

10 NADH >> Energy + 10 NAD+ + 10 Hydrogen.
This energy is used to pump some protons out of the inner membrane of the mitochondria. They went back through the ATP synthase creating at most 3 ATP for each NADH, for a total of 30 ATP (at most).
2 FADH? >> Energy + 2 FAD+ + 4 Hydrogen.
This energy is also used to pump some protons. This creates, at most, 2 ATP each FADH?, for a total of 4 ATP.

_Conclusion:_
_Total ATP created: 38 molecules, if the cell is very efficient._
_2 ATP is spent in glycolysis so there would be at most 40 ATP that went through the steps._
_10 NAD+ were used, and probably reused._
_2 FAD+ were used, and also probably reused._
_6 O? were used and they became 6 CO? in the Krebs Cycle._
_2 Oxaloacetic Acid were used and reused._
Hope this helps!"	1
Great content, I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na?ve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 10.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from  Feven Lena. I would advise yall to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about..??	2

3DS just felt so special. I didn't expect it but found myself really into Pokmon Sun and Moon. I think Pokmon Refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team, and I found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my Mismagus held on to the end for me. I know it ruins the game for some people (the Pokmon holding on has a higher rate of stopping KO than the focus band, apparently but don't quote me on that) but for me it was JUST want i wanted as a jaded almost-30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game.	2
TechLead this is a fantastic video, very well done. In my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science. I found that there are classes in every major that use computers and computer programming extensively. In math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis.  In physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card.  We programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data. I think you are 100% correct when you state that the act of programming is very important for every discipline.	2

I worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out. The problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused. You can barely keep up. Though I got promoted regularly, my higher ups told me the truth before they left, they said that I was severely underpaid based on my skills (essentially I branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as I am both technically knowledgeable, people oriented and strategic). I maxed out at $50K. So I decided to jump ship with little planned. Now I run a financial agency with my husband and we make $250K a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle.	0

It'd be nice that even when digital takes over for games that they offer a buy from the manufacturer option where you could order a physical copy online and get it shipped from wherever they made the game.

"thanks for sharing your experiences! The manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists (a category I wasn't aware of before this video) was odd to me. So he was saying that there wasn't enough data science related work for a full time hire (or else he wouldn't be wanting someone who could also serve as a software engineer). I can imagine companies having this need (smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats), but if I were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist, I'd avoid this manager/company! I actually left a job in the 90s for this reason--I was being pulled into other jobs/tasks that weren't related to machine learning, so I left and joined a company I could do machine learning full time (I'm an old guy!  I predated data science, so in that time, it was called ""data mining"" or ""pattern recognition"". and yes, I'm using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though I know they aren't fully interchangeable). 

The manager is key--even if you like the company, if you don't respect or are respected by your manager, it will be an awful job. Remember that when you are being interviewed, you are also interviewing them! :)"	1

Great discussion! Thank you. Yuval said early in his talk that we should look to our governments to ensure that the youth of today receive the kind of education they need to survive in the future. I would suggest that national politicians are likely to be the future 'useless people'. My government (in Africa) has done nothing to help the people. All it has done is line the pockets of the politicians. Education is already being re-engineered today by the private sector - Udacity, Coursera come to mind. There are huge changes taking place through these and other similar organisations and their association with universities around the world. So the future of the youth of today depends on THEM. Thomas Friedman in his book 'Thank You for Being Late' suggests that the previous 'digital divide' between the educated and the lesser educated has gone and the new divide is the Motivational Divide. The youth of today need to be intrinsically motivated (and overcome the natural laziness that Yuval tells us about) and learn, and keep learning. What they need to know is WHAT to learn, then learn it with the help of the Internet, organisations like Udacity, Khan Academy, Coursera and coaches and mentors (teachers in the world of yesterday). Schools also need to embrace these changes.	1
You are a great presenter. I think it is great to have an example to support your video.

Great< video and some nice tips! This is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions. This could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount. Wealth is created during bear markets, not bull markets. If your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk. Let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon. I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 19` btc from day trading with  Karen Gauvin  in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.	2
How gorgeous is the MC20 in comparison to the 296? I love the rear 3/4 of the 296 but it's just ugly from the front. The MC20 with a MC12 livery would be my choice I think, would need the OPF's removed though to get some better sound out of it... or the Lotus and pay off my house :P :P	2

I like watching these videos cuz they do be inspiring me to continue my college education. In highscool I was a 2.0 gpa student. Barely putting the effort to muster a C. My only way getting into college was soccer but eventually I quit due to mental health. I was really depressed and didnt have any motivation for anything. Had no friends no job and overall I was in a bad state in hs. I just turned 20 now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer. But yeah wouldve wished i had better guidance and wished I could go back and change that so I wouldnt have made it harder on myself. I didnt even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life. Starting to change now How I am now and its honestly making me a better person and happier. Seeing you guys so happy at Yale is motivation and brings me joy. You guys are very smart and I also admire your hard work you put in and the sacrifice.	0

I just want to share that these tips helped me land my dream job. Fresh out of college as an engineer, I did great during a phone interview, but poorly in a face-to-face invterview for a fortune 500 company. I just didn't have pre-planned topics to answer some questions with and came off as unprepared and inexperienced. I didn't get the job then. 5 years later,  I wanted to redeem myself. This was a once in a lifetime job opportunity for me so I didn't want to miss my chance. I had a 30 minute interview with the executive director of engineering and was able to hit on all of my strengths clearly and concisely. I nailed it. I started by highlighting key aspects of the job posting, and then I thought about all of these interview questions and practiced my responses daily until they came out naturally. It landed me the job!	2

I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and you can't easily tell if it's going bullish or bearish.

Cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level. People who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view. Someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them, money. Unfortunately, office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded. They have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem. Best solution is to remove yourself from that environment.	0
"I have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives. I get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform. This coming Phil along Xbox's track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up, haven't exactly been praised as PlayStation's have been, this is more corporate weasel words. 

Xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises. Halo, Gears of War, um...I'm sure I'm forgetting some others. The line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption. 

Xbox has doing really well with Game Pass, but they are missing that killer app for the system."	0

Like Jane Goodall or Colin Powell - I'm a person that has a mission that's important to me, plus huge experience and knowledge that built me, and I'm proud, and what the world thinks is not my concern.	2

My sis got sent to a mental facility one time when she had a breakdown. One of the employees there made fun of the cuts on her arms In addition to this, another person there got a hold of a razor and slit her wrists and everyone had to witness. They were treated just as much like prisoners then as previous asylums, our system hasnt changed much at all unfortunately.	0

The reason triple AAA games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design.

Don't stress about it?, you have the pressure of scoring in the 90th percentile and not doing the worst out of all your friends.

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts. They been one step ahead of other analysis..	0

I am new to the stock market. Every stock that I bought so far, I was out of luck because I bought them when they were expensive. I feel I missed out on all the stock opportunities so far for the tech stocks.I believe having 75K yearly income would be a good investment so I want to plug all my savings into the stock market. I know this sounds a bit dull but I would like to know if I should learn investing or let somebody else (more capable like a FA) do it for me? Please share your thoughts.

"As someone who studies convict leasing in Tennessee, this is a great video. Just a couple corrections:
1. Tennessee prisoners were NOT sent to Birmingham. They were leased to Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company (it's a little more complicated than that, but we can go with that for simplicity's sake) who used prisoners in their mines in Tennessee. After convict leasing ended in Tennessee in 1896, Tennessee Coal and Railroad moved its headquarters to Birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there, but those were Alabama prisoners, NOT Tennessee prisoners. 
2. States absolutely used convict leasing to make money. The lease on the Tennessee State Penitentiary could not be sold for less than $100,000 PER YEAR beginning in the mid-1880s. That would be over $2 million per year in today's money. 
3. Selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers. The idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner. They would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didn't know, and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses. Hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal.

"My first experience with gangs was working in a hospital and having a patient come in with severe trauma from a motorcycle accident. He looked much like this guy, tattooed from head to toe with his gang numbers and multiple scars from stabbings and gun shots. The guy didn't make it and when we called the family to tell them he was dying his mother's reply was ""he brought this upon himself with the life he was living"", no one showed up through his dying process. I ended up sitting with him after my shift was over until he passed. In the end,  I didn't care what he had done in his life I just wanted him to know someone cared for him regardless.

What most people don't understand is that basic education is 80% culture.

This is such an emotional experience. To know what it feels like to have your life in danger was terrifying. Our dinosaur dying at the end to show that we all meet the end of life sooner or later was very smart writing. The giant boulder chasing the dinosaur, representing the death he was running from was perfectly done. The dinosaur running faster after witnessing the deaths of his pterodactyl friends shows how the dinosaur felt.  The monochrome background also works in to express the traumatization that the poor rex experienced.	1

Hey, thanks for including the bit about the neutron lifetime question. I have worked on the UCNtau experiment and its nice to see this parameter mentioned as an important question. For those curious, the lifetime is believed to be around 880 sec, but the statistics are still underperforming, and of course this result deviates from the older bottle/beam experiments by such a degree that there is not yet a consensus.	1

"A very important thing is left out I think. Shakespeare was aiming for a wide range of accessibility so that he could pay his bills. He wrote for the ignorant barbarous ""ground- ling"" and for the intellectual as well. Milton actually says in the opening invocation of book 7 of Paradise Lost ""Still govern thou my song, Urania, and fit audience find, though few!"". He's pretty aware that he wont be liked by a great number of people but wants to ""soar above th' Aonian mount"" anyhow."	1

Great video! As an established data scientist myself, this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle; however, I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day. You can spend whole days just cleaning data, tuning models, or putting things into production. The work that you do can also vary by company, some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization. I have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested!	2

The biggest change Apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues.  That means no longer lying to their customers, not abusing them, not wallet r@ping them for profit, not gaslighting them,  being honest about how private Apple products *REALLY* are, not using decieving marketing, etc.  That way, they might start to get back some of their credibility back. At this stage they have a *HUGE* problem on their hands, as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around.	0

"Compared to the same time last year, I feel like I'm living in the cloud 9. 3 games, 3 wins, 9 points, 9 goals scored with only 2 goals allowed. Can you believe that?

For ones like Tierney, Tomiyasu, and Smith Rowe who were main starters for Arsenal last season, we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by. I hope they can be patient, grab the opportunities, and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on. Compared to the last season, this is a huge improvement. The squad depth is so much thicker that we are using Tomiyasu, Smith Rowe, and Tierney as substitutes. Hopefully next week, I would like to see Vieira to make a debut even if it's just for 10 or 20 minutes."	2
A Writer's Odyssey is very original and entertaining. It has flaws, but it's wildly imaginative. Fantasy? Sci-Fi?  Pure action epic?  It's hard to say what genre it belongs to.

I can actually see Hollywood doing a remake on it because its story is so original and amazing.	2

There's even an internal joke where the excuse for the lowball is ""we pay 5-10% of the market"" lmao. But overall I think it boils down to the team (at least for me). If the difference between the offers is around 20%, I would choose one which has better WLB and more interesting work. I hope you enjoy your new endeavor!

theory: the reason why you saw a second karl might have something to do with abandoned cars like Cristine. Karl is the first abandoned car and over time it withered and due to the desert heat its paint melted all over it making it all covered in blue paint and eventually a bunny accidently glitched in there and died and they're soul got sucked in creating the first karl which then killed the player and over time the karl became more and more smart and even attained sentience and started converting other cars into karls and karrot and karla were his first ones which had a few problems which is why they are diffrent eventually karl found out about you and how many times you abandoned cristine and the last time you did he converted all of the old ones (he kept on finding new ones not going back and getting them back) and are now mad at you and your stupid sedan. it also explains why he keeps coming back	1

He managed to break into the field without a CS degree but the company he worked for
had to downsize. They decided to lay off all employees who didn't have a 4-year degree.

investment for increased job security within such a volatile field of work."	2

I actually pondered on how dragons would be able to breath fire and I brought the topic up to my mom. I had the idea that they had to have an organ in their body that would produce a highly reactive gas, or liquid, and that when it was forced out it would either ignite from the oxygen or something else would ignite it internally, which is where my mom got the idea that Dragons would have a crop like chickens have, and throughout a dragons lifetime they would eat rocks of Flint that would go into that crop. When the dragon needed to breath fire that crop would constrict extremely fast while the gas/liquid came up, igniting and sending out flames. The Dragons internals being protecting by a thick, flame retardant, mucus.	1

In my younger years I guided Flyfishing in Alaska. When Looking out the window of the float plane, sometimes Id see ponds that almost looked like they were boiling. It was natural gas coming up through the permafrost. The Arctic regions of Europe have these same stores of natural gas.

Cool little detail you might have missed is that at the beginning when that guy finds the Spear of Destiny and then turns and looks over his shoulder at seemingly nothing, it was because he sensed Constatine was behind him. Later on in the movie when Constatine uses that electric chair to track  down where the Spear is, it shows him standing behind the guy when he finds the Spear. So it's like a little time travel thing.	1

"Imagine this:
You wake up in a room that you've never seen before. The bed you're lying in is very comfortable. You sink right into it. You don't want to leave, but you want to know where you are. You sit up, and looking around the room, you see that it looks like you're in a very cozy, but very old room. This room has seen many, many things, it seems. There's a mirror to use, in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice. There is a closet full of clothes, however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you. If you prefer the feminine choice, it is a beautiful seafoam green dress, with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees, grouped with black mary janes and long, white socks. The masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas, with black dress shoes. You put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room. You go down the stairs of the house to find two people. They look like blonde twins. One is a boy, the other is a girl. They are sipping their tea when one of them notices you. 
""Oh! You're awake!"" The boy cries. ""So they are!"" The girl replies. They introduce themselves as Aaron and Anastasia. Aaron tells you that, since you've been asleep all morning, it would be good for you to go outside with them. You reluctantly agree, but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside. You see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves. There are mountains in the distance, and you can also see a nice pond. In the sky, you can see the moons, and even a planet or two. You can even faintly see the stars. There are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings. The three of you walk up to that tree, and you spend the rest of the day playing there, the twins took turns pushing you on the swing. Eventually, night came, and you went back to the house for dinner. Anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta you'd ever had, and Aaron did the dishes, insisting that you relax as their guest. After a little while, you retired to your bedroom, changed into the clothes given to you, and succumbed to a calm, dreamers sleep, wondering what the next day had in store for you..."	2

Peribahasa orang tamak selalu rugi tu benar. Apa lagi yang tak cukup dengan Jawatan dan Gaji yang besar sebagai Perdana Menteri? Apa yang kurang dalam kehidupan seorang Perdana Menteri? Lebih menyedihkan, seorang muslim, beragama Islam, seorang pemimpin yg sepatutnya jadi teladan tapi berkelakuan sebaliknya. Semalam, beliau buat sumpah laknat, hari ni beliau ke penjara. Sedangkan semua bukti telah ditunjukkan di mahkamah bahawa ternyata beliau melakukan kesalahan, beliau masih berani bersumpah dengan nama Allah. Begitu mudah ucap dan permainkan nama Allah serta agamanya. Cukup ada seorang penyangak Najib di Malaysia ni, jangan kita benarkan dan lahirkan lebih ramai penyangak seperti Najib di masa akan datang. Jangan jadikan Malaysia kotor dan jijik di pndangan negara dunia lain.	1

ABOUT SFS (SAMPLER FEEDBACK STREAMING): The demo starting at the?50 second mark?was configured to run in 4K and each object is a 16k x 16k BC7 texture. Ordinarily, this would take up 350MB of GPU memory for each individual object. The demo features 985 such objects, which would take up nearly 300 GB (yes, that's GB, not MB) of?GPU?memory. However, as can be seen in the video, allocated VRAM usage is just over 3 GB, and dedicated VRAM usage is just over 2 GB! SFS allows for visuals that simply would not otherwise be possible due to memory constraints.	1

"Ive been been watching all of your videos while stressing about midterms! Currently still in my undergrad and Im looking for a bit of advice. Currently Im planning on majoring in computer science with a minor in statistics. Would a data Analytics, or information systems degree from the business school be better? Or should I stick with the more technical with CS with the stats minor? 

Looking at data science jobs, nearly all of them I see require a masters degree or PHD, which I definitely dont have the money for. I see plenty of data analyst and data engineer jobs that are open to the bachelor degree level candidates. Is making a transition from one of those two rolls into data science relativity easy?"	1

"Its always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk. The cgi looks terrible, the marvel humor is painfully unfunny, and Im getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes, Im not watching it simply because it has women in it. 

You hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation. Nobody cares about the characters identity, people only get annoyed when the actors, directors, and studios start sucking themselves off and act like theyre MLKJs successor. Its also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product. 

Same thing with their messages. Sure there are some good messages like choosing love and dont be racist, but they do a terrible job of conveying them. Also I dont think a corporation thats constantly getting accused of discriminating against race, religion, gender, ethnicity, panders to intolerant international consumers, has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them, does business with oppressive governments, and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance."	0

Thank you for your videos mate.<The BTC shows us that when he wakes up he knows how to do it and destroy all the bears!! Never go against the trends on cryptos, even less put levers, it is about the immediate sanction as soon as you turn your back, now anyone who has been in the crypto space for the last 6 or more years certainly knows about the cycle structure, every 4 yearsBTC goes through a halving even where the amount of Bitcoin that is mined is cut half. Well, the block reward is cut in half. this cause huge price spikes every 4 yrs because it create a supply and demand crisis that can't be priced in until it's a reality. >but all thanks to *WTRADE INSPECTS* who taught me how to make trade and increased my Crypto from 2.5 to 10BTC now.

Its buyer behavior. It goes beyond buying up multiple sizes to see what fits. Ive sold on eBay for years with no issue. Same individual item again and again. One year I sold on Amazon and I was blown away by the types of buyers I had. Many requested a cancellation of purchase, which I gladly did. I dont want to have to pay for return shipping due to a mistake the buyer made. Many also requested a return claiming the item was defective, but when I paid for the item to be shipped back to me due to Amazons return policies, the item would be returned in perfect working condition. I dont know if people are buying suggested items without thinking, or assuming theyll get something free if they complain, but I cant imagine the horror if I had to trash every single return I got. Sometimes, after paying for the return shipping label, the buyer would never ship. All they had to do was print off the label and schedule a pickup, but the act of deciding to keep it without any further communication beyond return approval makes me believe they were after a freebie.	1

Now that I've seen some of your vids, I understand why. Glad I found your channel on YouTube:)	2

On the first one it works because when your hand is closer to one side, the friction slows it down on each side until when your fingers meet and the object is balanced.

I absolutely love Professor Brian Cox, after watching his TedTalk about a year ago I watched as many videos of him as I could and he has incredibly increased my interest in physics and astronomy! Thank you for the great video!	2
I am officially on a quest to watch all your videos! You are GREAT!! Btw what would you recommend for someone pivoting into the field with no experience?	2
That freethrow alone tells you Green can be upgraded.  Unless he starts shooting the three at a 50+ percentage, contested and 80 to 90 percent wideopen...  UPGRADE HIM WARRIORS!	1
"Personally I think you hit one key point: the importance of domain experts.  With the so-called automation or new technology/ tools we'll likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs.  Just because someones knows SQL or do coding doesn't mean he/she can do data science or machine learning -- or more importantly, to put out anything meaningful or even useful.  Just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of high-skill tools (say photoshop) really well to even modify a picture or video.  These days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to Instagram or Tiktok.  Did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct? No.  But it does mean that you need to be REALLY GOOD to be able to survive as a graphic designer.  I see the same future for data science field too.  Maybe not tomorrow, but the trend is coming for sure.  If you pay attention to some of the podcasts like ""me myself and ai"", most the guests (chief data scientists or boss of DS departments) aren't really of these backgrounds but more business driven."	1

Hey Daniel, just discovered your channel a couple days ago and I'm learning lots. Thank you!	2
I totally agree on internships! I am a graduating senior in Computer Engineering, and I have done 4 internships. Internships really showed me what working was really like, and helped me find where I want to work. Despite being in the depressed COVID economy, I already have a job offer lined up for when I graduate in December!	2

My 10yo daughter loves axolotls. I dont know why Im being particularly emotional from this video, but it has really made me cry. Im going to look and see what digital adoptions there are for axolotls. My daughter has a birthday coming up and a good gift would be a sponsorship in her name. Shes just a bit too young to keep one herself; maybe in high school if shes still into it.	2
I love love LOVE that the search inquiries tell little separate stories as they progress. Like the guy finding out dead ppl don't pay taxes, faking his death, and the cops trying to determine if it's a mannequin or a real guy.	2

"Wonderful video!  I first got into <BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying sats at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy these dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 9.5  BTC with 2.4btc in just 5weeks from day trading with Expert MR Jack Muller Crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase   it goes bearish. Technical analysis is my second language <You can reach MR Jack Muller on   ?eI???m??JACKMULLER

So my University currently has both Software Engineering and Computer Science. Both majors are pretty much the same thing and the only difference is about 3 or 4 classes. For example, for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, there is CIS 350 (theory based) and CIS 3501 (SE side of the class) also the core requirements has SE majors take SE 2 after SE 1 while CS majors only take SE 1. So its really the same degree, same requirements, only difference is a couple of classes (that are very similar).	1

Nice. Definitely a great value.  I still have my old Lenovo 960M 4GB gaming laptop. I never upgraded it from 8gb of ram and that would've been an easy move for more performance.

I like that he mentioned the omelette thing. Many years ago I took culinary classes when I considered trying to become a chef, and an instructor I had emphasized the importance of a good omelette for restaurant interviews. Glad to know I wasn't led astray in that	2

it's not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning. Sometimes you want to limit your dataset. For example if you're trying to figure out if you're in a stock market recession or expansion you don't want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you'll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources	0

For those who are curious: Not only is it widely accepted that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, but we also know exactly WHERE the asteroid landed: it's called the Chicxulub crater. It's located on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula and has been carbon-dated to have formed in that time period, and it size of the crater certainly looks catastrophic enough.	0

Actually same ??, I also sing a lot when I want to relax/let stress go, most of the times I do it unconsciously, and I've learned a lot of songs perfectly word by word doing it through the years ??, both Italian and English ones ??.

I really appreciate how you talked about stress in this video, everything you said about it, your personal experience with it, how you deal with it/let it go, and especially all the little advices you gave us, stuff like this can be very helpful ??.

I also really enjoyed all the triggers of course ??, the iconic asking for consent about touching the viewer's face at the beginning, the stress pulling with the camera sometimes focusing on your hand and staying on it while it was moving back, which I tought looked really cool, the sound of the scissors snipping, the little sponge, everything, thank you as always Gibi ??."	2

I certainly remember being much better at being creative when I was younger, but now that I'm a freshman in High School, I've noticed that I'm much worse at the whole creativity thing. Now, the problem is, I'm being praised. Why? I am great at finding the one answer. I can take tests very well, but am typically not the best at projects. Math is my best subject, English is my worst, where you typically have to write creative essays. I want to be an engineer, so at my school, we have an elective called pre-engineering. It's one of the closest classes to an actual job that's available at my school. And I'm not the best at it. Sure I can do the math required, but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard.?I feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future. It's telling me that there's one answer, which is never the case in engineering. I hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul, and realize that we need to change education.	0

Probably what they know is that prices for all cryptos are incredibly low right now and it's a great time to buy.  Instead of being filled with angst and fear, they are showing a little courage and going ahead and stacking up their bags at a time when it makes a lot of sense to do so.  I think people need to stop being so fearful.  Now is the time to BUY.  That should be pretty clear by now. Anyone who's shorting and selling and worrying about whether the bottom is in etc doesn't really know what they're doing.	1

Reminds me of that customer who said the screen works and when you plugged it in in front of them it miraculously seemed to have stopped working during the customers trip to the shop. I remember years ago my friend had an old Nokia dropped off as it was under warranty, he reported it simply stopped working when taken apart it was soaked with water internally, all the markers were bright red. You could even see condensation on the inside of the screen! Yet according to the customer it was never exposed to water and he was trying to scam him out of his warranty customers will be customers. Thankfully many are honest!	1

When I was growing up, we lived next to a farm.  The farmer that lived there had a unique ability to find four leaf clovers. And not just four leaf clovers. He also found five, six and seven leaf clovers! He pressed and framed about ten of them and presented it to my parents once. It was weird.	2

I agree with Gary at the end. It's tough being a dad when you have no good examples. Living through the same thing, have a 20-year-old and a 9-year-old. And doing the best I can. My father wasn't really there, stepdad was so so but not the best father skills. And really had no other man in my life to get guidance from as a father. We do the best for our kids and that's all we can do.	1

My grandfather fought on the german side from the beginning to the bitter end of this battle, then spent months working inside a gulag as a miner, finally escaping few days before his unit was signed for execution. He never wanted to talk much about the war, only few stories about his comrades and struggle for survival, I guess he felt ashamed for all the suffering nazis brought to this world. I remember the day I asked him about it, he didn't say anything, my grandmother took me on a side and told me to never ask him about a Stalingrad.	0

"Some of my favorite Voltaire quotes (this man was a genius!):

""Being a bird ain't all about flying and shitting from high places.""

""It requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mother's womb, and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood, to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear. It has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure. It would need eternity to learn something about his soul. It takes an instant to kill him.""

""Of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most tolerance, but until now Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.""

""Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool.""

""Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.""

""If you have two religions in your land, the two will cut each others throats; but if you have thirty religions, they will dwell in peace.""

""What can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying God rather than men, and that as a result he's certain he'll go to heaven if he cuts your throat?""

""Behind every successful man stands a surprised mother-in-law.""

 ""It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge.""

""Animals have these advantages over man: they never hear the clock strike, they die without any idea of death, they have no theologians to instruct them, their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies, their funerals cost them nothing, and no one starts lawsuits over their wills.""

""The human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe.""

""Our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road.""

""Every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time.""

""Despite the enormous quantity of books, how few people read! And if one reads profitably, one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day.""

""I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life. This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities, for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away, to loathe ones very being and yet to hold it fast, to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away?""

""Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.""

""The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing.""

""It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.""

""God is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh."""	1

I think it's safe to say that before trusting in systems like Google Maps, one must research the routes those systems suggest you take before going on your adventure, especially if those routes are longer than the comfort zone of your own city. For example, before I go on a long drive to a destination I have never been to before, I always check the routes on Google Maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view. Then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one. It's unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did. So it's a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory. Like my husband's parents, they always have a large jug of water in their car, along with a week's worth of rations, First Aid Kit, blankets, flares, etc, even though they rarely go off the beaten path.	1

My son is a senior in high school this year. He says he might choose community college but doesn't want a 4 year university. Trade school is fine too. I think he just doesn't know what he wants to do with his life yet and that's okay. I went to college and spent 12 years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me. I don't understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they haven't even had the opportunity to live life yet. I want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one. I'm in no rush to kick him out. All I ask is that he works or goes to school. I don't want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job. I want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly. I don't want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet. He can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so. There's no age limit.	0

"As a computer science major who will soon be working in NYC as a software engineer, I agree with many of the points in this video. My first-year salary will exceed $100k after only a bachelor's degree. Although this is due to a combination of several internships done during college,  the cost of living in New York, and sheer luck and blessings, many of my peers are also finding roles with great compensation.

if any high schoolers, college students, or even people out of school are considering learning how to code, I strongly urge you all to make the leap."	2

"In my personal experience the harsh reality also included:
1. Studying all the time, to the point that you personal life gets affected.  8 hours of work and 4 hours a day  of just keep up with the new lake, cloud , software, technique, library , bi tool etc. 
2. The feeling of ""You don't know enough"", ""You are not enough"". You briefly mention this and I am glad that  I am not the only feeling the same way. I know python enough to do my job, but I am not a python expert who can write functions from scratch, or change between languages say from python to  java or R.

"It's been 4 years since graduating with my computer engineering degree. Pay is amazing. Benefits are amazing. Flexibility is amazing. The projects are (usually) interesting. There are so many openings in computing. There are so many business opportunities as well. It's absolutely insane! I think companies are really, really desperate for talent right now. I got lucky ending up in Silicon Valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world. At my university, computer engineering was 85% computer science, 15% electrical/electronics engineering. It's functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned. I chose to take robotics electives in school but don't actually use those skills in my job. I'm just a standard software developer/engineer. Haha.

I have a friend who went the boot camp route and struggled a lot in the field, being the first target during layoffs and having to learn A TON of stuff that boot camps just don't cover. With some tutoring and some years of on-the-job training he is doing OK now, too. I'd definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning, artificial intelligence, programming languages, computer graphics, game development, distributed systems, and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry you're interested in."	2
Just about to finish my first year studying statistics. A short course was about machine learning so I have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video. We got to use and tweak different types of predictor models.

It's all crazy right now and I've hung in there for 2021 and this year, I feel like I can't take it anymore. So, I need to DCA some and be ready to take more unrealized loss for a bit of time.

Being a trade professional such as plumbing or HVAC can be VERY lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years. If you can become the name that people automatically think of for HVAC problems - you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you. You can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire - with a tech school diploma - you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service.	2

"I have a high paying tech job that Im about to leave. I feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it, even though I worked hard to get to where I am. I was promoted very fast after 5 years. I know its something many people would love to have and honestly Im happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot. Ultimately I became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life. I have lived humbly, saved every thing I could, paid off debts as quickly as possible, and have enough to live for 8 months to a year. Im hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling.

For anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining, I hope you achieve your dream and get one. You can do it, keep at it! Taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing. I am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me (dont let that scare you, I just have my own personal stuff too ??)."	2

9:40 I have a question here: For example, if that is a part around the 7, this part is a certain amount of pixels in the square. It looks like you always have to write the numbers in the middle so that the network recognizes this. Is it possible that you write a 7 on the far right or on the left or on the top or bottom and the network recognizes that anyway?	1

"1. Skim through the questions 
2. Actually read the passage carefully once 
3. First kind of question: main theme- save for last
    Second kind: vocab- seeing the words that you do know and use the process of elimination 
    Third kind: Paired questions- pair the choices from the questions 
4. Remember that these types questions are meant to have a single answer 
5. Underline main subject and main verb

7. Read through the whole paragraph before they ask you to change the structure of the paragraph"	1

"Watched this tonight as part of an adult education course and wante to say that this video perfectly articulates why I want to go back to education.
I also feel the majority of the points can be applied to all types of great art, whether it be it a beautiful painting, a song, a movie even a comic (Sandman) or a TV Show (The Wire) 
In answer to a few of the comments below the video was specifically speaking about what literature is for therefore that is the only subject/medium it should analyse but I agree that any ""great"" art can teach us what it means to be human. "	2

If I have these videos back in my college days I could have done a lot better in my grades and career.  I am planning to watch all of your videos for reviewing and sharpening up my skills in maths.  You are a genius.  Thank you.	2

Just what I needed to know to start making my first game, Call of Mario.	2
"It seems like they're actually going for a serious story this time! I hope they manage to pull it off. The cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to. I was pretty sold on playing this game but now I'm really excited! 
(Also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out. I guess it'll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later)"	2
"John Romero used to say that the first level in the game was the last level he designed. 
By that time, you already know what the whole game is going to play like, and you can use that knowledge to weave it all together seamlessly. 
It works perfectly for somewhat simple games like Commander Keen and DOOM, and I'd like to think that it still works for more advanced or narrative-driven games.

Thoughts?"	2

I think you literally just saved my life , Ive been struggling to find a way out. Im currently an N.A waiting to get certified because of covid and stuff but I support myself and my grandma. I dont have anyone to turn to for help, Ive been trying to save but I cant because of bills and renting my apartment and everything. But this, literally helped me look to a brighter future. My grandma is crippled so she cannot do work or anything. Most people have parents to turn to but I dont talk to my mom or dad. This literally helped me so much because since i met *MitnickCorp?Org*  the real issue i have about debt was solve in some weeks am sure before Feb of my birthday i will be home owner.	2

I found this video to be very well done!! When I begin work on a new model, I always start with a Google search, and go from there. Unfortunately, you can't do this during an interview. I feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked, all the time, just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper, and build out a model. I've been in the data science world for the past 10 years, and that's 10 years of proven success. If that's not good enough for you, writing code on a blank sheet of paper won't help very much at all.	2
The thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas. I love seeing diversity, its a wonderful thing, but it shouldnt come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation. Just write good stories and good characters, its remarkably simple.	0

I love your maps, they are fantastic! ?Thank you for putting them together, they are super helpful. ?One nitpick - what about Microbiology? ?This is a VERY important subject, given that unicellular microorganisms vastly outnumber the multicellular organisms most people are familiar with. ?Of course, I may be biased, since I am a microbiologist...anyway, keep up the great work! ?I am blown away by the breadth of your knowledge, and have learned a ton about scientific fields I am less familiar with through your work.	2

There was one single semester in undergrad that I was able to set my schedule up so that everyday I had a class start at 10:00 a regular lunch break and evening classes that ended by 6. And my dorm happened to be a single with a LOT of windows and natural light. Having a consistent schedule that matched my night owl rhythm and light regulation was the best sleep I ever felt (it was also the most consistent Ive ever been in the gym since quitting high school sports) Followed by a semester where classes started at either 8:30 or 2pm on alternate days and my worst semester both grade and mental-health wise	2

This subject is one of my current greatest fears. With our current understanding, it seems likely that we'll either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isn't; or, on the other hand, make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it, perhaps for a very long time. The former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me. True AGI could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe; but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance.... That's just fucking heart-breaking. There's something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it. It's like neglecting *the first* child. The first god-child.	0

"I live in the Netherlands, Europe. And got news for you, we are already in an energy crisis. Gas price has gone 12x at the moment compared to prices pre Covid. That translates in 4x the price if you need a nrw energy contract. So people here pay easy 600 a month instead of 150 euro.
But in 2023 prices are expected 800 to 1000 euros a month. That means an insane recession. You think the bearmarket is almost over? Think again...it only just started"	0

Das Highlight, (wenn es denn berhaupt kommt) drfte die Apple Watch Pro werden (vor allem beim  Preis ????) oder die normale Apple Watch im kantigen Design. Das neue iPhone (ob nun gro? oder klein) wirkt fr mich pers?nlich, recht unspektakul?r (Recycling IPhone Pro aus dem Vorjahr), gleiches gilt fr die iPhone Pro-Modelle.  Ob nun Pille oder Notch ? Selbst wenn die Kamera jetzt noch ?unbelievable w?re, wrde mir das keine 1200 Euro, aus der Geldb?rse locken. Ich denke, es wird auch das letzte iPhone, mit einem A-Chip berhaupt sein. N?chstes Jahr wird auch das iPhone auf den M-Chip umgestellt. Meiner Meinung nach, l?ngst berf?llig. Ich rechne noch fest mit neuen AirPods oder AirPods Pro. Interessant drfte sein, was mit dem Apple TV passiert ? Auch mit der ?berarbeitung des HomePod Mini rechne ich fest. Von einem neuen, alten ?HomePod, gehe ich derzeit nicht aus. Mich pers?nlich interessiert nur die neue Watch, da bei meine 4er, langsam der Akku schlapp macht und Apple n?chstes Jahr, bei dem 4er Modell, den Software-Hahn endgltig zudrehen wird. Das wird vielen so gehen, da viele noch das 4er Modell haben und schon seit einem Jahr auf das kantige Design warten. Aber eins steht fr mich auch ganz klar fest: Kein kantiges Design, keine neue Apple Watch ! Dann muss die 4er, bei mir noch ein Jahr, irgendwie weiter berleben. ??????	1

The goal of evaporation is to cool down the leaf. The reason leafs are green is to avoid absorbing too much radiation. The sun produces a lot of energy, and similar to humans a tree needs to protect himself from sunlight. Think about how hot it gets at solar noon, and the fact that the tree needs to sit in direct sunlight for the entire day. The tree is literally cooling itself down through evaporative cooling, similar to how humans do it through sweating. This process is known as evapotranspiration.	1

"An interesting footnote from history. After the conference in Tehran in 1943, it was decided that the Allies would start delivering aid to the Yugoslav partisans and that aid to the Yugoslav monarchists would be stopped. When, after the conference, one of the British members of the delegation told Churchill that he had sold Yugoslavia to the communists, Churchill asked him: ""will you live in Yugoslavia after the war?"" The delegate replied that he wouldn't, to which Churchill added: ""I won't either, so why bother?"""	1
"I like how the ""true dragons"" didn't end up looking like the ""stereotypical"" dragon. Instead they had a very Quetzalcoatl appearance, which makes it believable. As cool as a dragon looking like Draco from Dragonheart would be, I could see a pterosaur-like dragon being more realistic."	2

"Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments. Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future. Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for, Success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it.

"46:24 This is actually insanely important and probably underrated advice. There was a time in my life where I ended up stifling all of my random ideas in the name of ""higher priorities"", and it unwittingly spiraled me into 2-3 years of burnout and depression. This is all in retrospect, because at the time I thought I was doing the right thing, but it's extremely clear to me now that you *need* to give yourself the freedom to create and explore; eventually you'll find the balance of how much time you should set aside for those tangents, and sometimes those tangents turn out to be a core part of your final work! (Sometimes they turn out to be nothing too, but don't be discouraged, just have fun!)

Overall I loved all of these speakers, really excellent session!"	1
On your future review, will you give us a comprehensive analysis on the anti-glare matte screen? Is the matte coating embedded within the panel or is it another layer?

As a 33 year veteran teacher, I suggest that you talk to teachers about their working conditions. The disrespect has infected the classrooms.

Making a separate comment for this: One thing you didn't mention in the exploding vape part of the video is *counterfeit batteries*. You mentioned faulty batteries, poorly designed vapes, but I think this is a big one that should not be left out. Most people who vape seek out batteries from known reputable brands, however there's a huge problem of cheap, counterfeit imitations of those batteries being sold under the original brand name *even on places like Amazon*. Amazon have a huge problem with counterfeit products being sold through their website and it has really tarnished their brand in many people's eyes	0

As an undergrad, I had to take history, and I'm an math/science person who hates history. On my own, I learned to rearrange stories in my head to make it make sense to me. I would exchange real people with people I knew to relate to the topics. I scores a hundred on about every exam when most were struggling. The nstructor made a comment that it was one person who always scored a hundred. They were like who who because there's no way. His tests were long. When I told them what I was doing to remember the content, they laughed, but I was like it works. And believe it or not, I still remember most of it and that was 22 years ago.	0

Your one of the best coders one YouTube, thanks for helping me on my journey	2
"This movie's actually a play on the 1940s ""film noir"" style of filmmaking,  movie's like _The Maltese Falcon,_ _The Big Sleep,_ or later on stuff like _Chinatown_ about a jaded detective  starting what seems like a simple case to pay the bills but quickly spirals into a complex web of competing parties where just when you've got it all figured out, a new piece of info puts everything into a totally different light.

So basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the ""detective"" was an aging hippy with no sense of self-motivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it. 

At the time it came out, people compared it to their previous film _Fargo,_ which while it had distinctly Minnesotan humor it was still a serious ""true""-crime story in the end. But comparison _The Big Lebowski_ is a lot sillier and plays around a lot more with genre while ultimately having a story that's ""about nothing"", and people didn't like it. 
It became what's known as a cult classic after it came out on home video when all the couch potatoes gave it a second chance."	1

I used to work in a used game store. We would refurbish GameStop refurbished consoles literally daily from people who had them for just a little over a month. GameStop refurbishes are known for taking shortcuts at every possible turn, and using the cheapest replacement parts available. We had a local GameStop that was notorious for ignoring thermal paste on literally everything they did. So much so we put out a social media post letting everyone in our area know we would redo the thermal paste in any GameStop console they purchased within a week with proof, for $10. Fuck GameStop	1

I remember getting in line for a subway at Delhi int airport. there was a line of say 6 people of which, 4 were non-indians. I was getting late and the line seemed huge. I was also wondering why so many foreigners were eating vegetarian, then one of them got in the front and the cashier told him that the non-veg line was on the other side and then they looked up and spotted that they were standing in the vegetarian line. The entire queue moved and I got my sub in time for my flight. Fun times!	2

I think that google is just trying to stay competitive with other tech companies. Its probably very difficult for them to allow people to advance in the company when you are always working with amazing talent and hard working people.  And regarding the perk dilemma to keep you working. You can drive your own vehicle. Not eat dinner at google and also they offer fully remote positions. I think the problem is employees, especially new ones, see the progress and dedication of other employees and work tirelessly in hopes of matching that same progress. Thus the burnout dilemma.	0

Moving over to iOS from Android in September, looking at picking up the iPhone 14 Pro Max if I can get a great deal. At a later date I'm looking at adding Airpods Pro 1 or 2.

"As an Asian who was actually born and brought up in Asia, I had never felt issues watching Western shows and their ""flawed"" representation. I mean if I want to watch a local movie I would just watch one from my own country, as there is no way Americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves. This is until I am being lectured about how representation works and how happy I should be watching Americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them. I mean seriously, you are telling me your representation of Chinese is representing all the world's Chinese? That is patronizing as hell, because I can tell you there are so many differences between American Chinese, China Chinese and other Chinese living in different parts of the world. Crazy Rich Asians just made me cringe so hard, yes I am from Singapore.

I believe No Way Home would be the last good MCU movie for a long time ever, if not forever. Tried to watch Dr Strange 2, but felt like they killed the original Dr Strange and replaced him with a fake.

If you want a good representation movie in recent times. Try Everything Everywhere All At Once. Great representative movie, not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story, showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background, plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life . I mean they even represented rocks, who else can top it?"	0

"@MKBHD I""m a photographer and use the Peak EDC V2.  I'm impressed you got a 16"" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)"	2

Before ruling Rome, he was an admirable person and soldier, as he (along with the future Emperor Vespasian) greatly assisted Emperor Claudius during the conquest of Britain, not to mention he was also a faithful husband, as he refused to cheat on his wife with none other than Agrippina the Younger (Caligula's sister and Nero's mother).
Anyway, I have absolute respect for Sempronius Densus, as he was capable to do something other centurions like Sejanus, Macro, Chaerea and Tigellinus couldn't: protect to the end the Emperor they swore allegiance instead of just stabbing him in the back"	1

One of the biggest things people should take into consideration if theyre gonna pursue any IT jobs or anything related to CS is that it never ends. Youll constantly be trying to keep up with the latest tech or wondering if you need to bring getting the newest CompTIA cert or if your current if good enough. Its a rough life especially if youre married or in a relationship, its just constantly hours in front of the screen.	0
This is one of the typical stories of the archipelago that was born from the Javanese kingdom of the Majapahit Kingdom, which used to triumph over the regional trade comoditie's market in the past before the friendship trade route was decided in the Colonial era???????????????????? - until it was colonized. 1500 - 1945, But the beginning of the story of all the great lands of Sundaland that did not have a master came 20.000 of centuries BC Hindu & Buddhist Indian, Chinese, Arabic, African Guinea = Melanesian, and indigenous Austronesian (Motherland), forming a great kingdom (still a big mystery) that was able to attack ancient Greece when the ancient Greeks came to the Kingdom. But Sundaland by that time had already been sunk by the climate of a large volcanic eruption, drowned by the ocean due to melting polar ice, and Austronesian was born the emergence of a small competing kingdom. =Sumatra (Sultan Samudera Pasai- Ottoman Empire wali songo periode & Sriwijaya Empire)west Java ( Padjadjaran empire) Central Java(Kingdom of Majapahit) ,????(Sultan of Malacca),????(Temasek), (Kingdom of Kutai) ????(Kingdom of Tondo & Butuan, Sultan of Sulu)????,????

"As the crypto market pauses with the stock market, I take a deep look into the Elliott Wave Theory count for the Dow Jones. A requirement for Bitcoin throughout all of its history has been that the stock market is rising.

Also, the amount of carbonation to syrup isn't set in the soda machines, and can be changed.  A soda with more carbonation is a 'dry' soda. A restaurant I loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup, and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet, whichever was your preference.	2

I'm a first year CS student at a major German university and my current classes are introduction to programming, computer architecture, automata theory, calculus and linear algebra. I went into it not having a background in CS at all, I really only went into it because I have a thing for logic and structure and I don't regret my decision at all! At the beginning I was worried because I didn't know how to code at all and I had to put in some extra hours in the beginning compared to the kids who have been doing this since they were in infant but it's totally possible.	0

The NES, SNES and N64 had no built-in startup, but most official Nintendo games would add those in if you inserted a cartridge. The spinning N that made the N64 famous would differ between games for example, and was sometimes differently (and even wrongly) colored. Furthermore, the GB and GBC also had a startup that you didn't inlcude, and the DSi system had a different startup from the original. Lastly, the GameCube had a 3rd startup version where the soundbites would change to Japanese chanting and shamisens, but it would only fire if you pressed the Z-button on 4 connected controllers at the same time.	1

"The biggest thing I've realized lately is that the more money you have, the more money you will want to spend.
So you never really feel like you have enough.
That's why I really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have.
This is especially true of us in the first world.
We get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff, that they are ""living the dream"".
But the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles.
And if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach.

The irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most.
They have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need.
So when they come to live here and get a job, they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff.
Their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money.
But the family doesn't realize that the ""cost of living is much higher"" where we live.
You never feel like you have enough."	2

These videos have opened my eyes to the beauty of philosophy and literature. It's such a comforting feeling to learn that the questions and often sad thoughts in my head have been thought of and so thoroughly worked on by these great men and women in the past. In the past two weeks since I've started to watch these videos, I have seriously reconsidered many topics and views I have on life. It's a shame American core curriculum doesn't require the teaching of philosophy and reasoning. If more people learned and discussed these issues, it could make our societies and lives so much more fulfilling..	2

After the GFC, we adopted MMT which basically means the only way to keep the economy going is to pump money into the M2 money supply, fiscal stimulus, lower rates, etc. With this change, the boom/bust cycles have become more frequent and dramatic. The emo chick is right, things did change after 2008 and the economy changed and will change again as part of the rest. Inflation isn't our biggest problem with MMT, but deflation will be the killer.	1

For your info, Suppo. Syscoin has been there for a while. I give you that, but for the last year, they have been renovating and adding new stuff to their dual L1, UTXO chain that is merged mined with BTC and a NEVM chain that offers smart contracts flexibility. These base layers will be kept for data availability (DA), to pave the way for their own L2s and , thus, infinite scalability. They are leading the way for modular blockchains. 
Please look into it once u find time. 
It's an L1 with so, sooo much potential that  wouldnt hurt to throw some $$$ there.

Everyone has been saying it but Ill throw my hat in as well. To any prospective college students, you DO NOT need to spend money on flagship products. I am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base iPad from late 2020. Both products have worked flawlessly and I have no intention of replacing them. The recommendations listed are ones I would never be able to afford even with my job Im working as well. Do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is. I promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it.	2

Pawn: The very first line of attack. Can move 2 spaces forward ONLY on the first move, while only moving 1 spaces forward the next move.

Knight: Moves in an L Shape, Can jump over pieces.

Bishop: Can move in an X shape (can go for how long you want it to be), Can't jump over pieces. 

Rook: Can go in a + Shape (Can go for how long you want it to be), Can't jump over pieces. You can do a move called ""Castle"" if your Rook can reach the king and both pieces haven't move (don't know if that last part is right)

Queen: Can go in a + and X shape. Can't jump over pieces.

King: Can move 1 spaces around it (like a 33 Square), Protect this piece as best as you can (A checkmate will be an immediate lose). Can't jump over pieces."	1

< I totally agree with what you are saying....The fact is, BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose, others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i would say trading has been going smoothly for me, i started with 2.5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11.6 BTC in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by *WTRADE INSPECTS*	1

Matt Smith portrayal of Daemon Targaryen was nothing short of perfection, he plays the character the way I imagined he would be in a live action format. Can't wait for yah to see more of him, also ladies this show is about the dance of dragons so yah won't be seeing the mad king in this show.	2

I suppose it's because I grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesn't really create a negative connotation for me with a game.  I know that if a game isn't wholly designed for the Switch that issues can occur with frame rates, pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games. I think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to.	2

The only reason I wanted to learn more about Quantum Physics is because I was listening to Dr Tysons podcast where he mentioned quantum entanglement and that Einstein didnt think it was a thing calling it spooky action at a distance. Now my brain is a contradiction in terms, in that Im Mathematically challenged (seriously algebra might as well be sandscript) but I understand calculus (Ive never found anyone that explain this to me lol). So when Dr Tyson was explaining Quantum entanglement I got the concept but I needed more info (like trying to understand how an engine works by looking at the fuel fill and exhaust pipe). And I know Im just some guy but after reading everything I could get my hands on (that wasnt written for PHD candidates) it dawned on me that this might be our ticket to the stars. My physics teacher in HS said that the only natural force that humans cant manipulate is Gravity and wed have to be able to manipulate it if we ever want to explore other solar systems. But (excuse my ignorance) if we can figure out how to manipulate quantum entanglement we would have the means to sidestep the cosmic speed limit	1

I am not totally sure about whether or not I want to be a Data Scientist. The interest towards learning has been kind of gradual for me. But for now I can say that my inclination is more on the side of Data cleaning, Data modelling and Data visualisation. I might probably end up somewhere close to being a Data Analyst, Can't imagine beyond that for now. Checked for all points that you mentioned. Bang on. Except for the last one - Marketing one's own work. I am someone who believes strongly in my work speaking for myself rather than otherwise. Have been trying hard to change this mindset of mine. Might take a while but will get to it definitely. Thanks for this informative one. Helped me clear my mind about certain things. See you on the next livestream.	1

I'm stoked for F4 casting. And while yes it's 2 years away, it was also announced in 2019, so they've had 3 years to cast it. And I'm willing to bet they had it cast before Watts left the project.

In the platform game, what if the guy asked the other people to go to the corner of the edge of the platform and reach their hand out so he can grab it. Since there's only a small opening in the center, they wouldn't be able to do it, and the distance seems to be close enough for this to work.	1

5:40 Another advantage of two's complement is that addition, subtraction, and multiplication on it are simpler. You just do the same as with unsigned values. One way to explain that is using modular arithmetic: unless you use long arithmetic, numbers are computed modulo 2 to the power of the number of bits in an integer, and the numbers that the same bit string represents in unsigned types and in two's complement are equivalent	2

I am so jazzed that the bronze age is getting more attention these days. When I was growing up it was completely glossed over in media and they skipped immediately to Alexander and to Rome, but the period of civilization before the bronze age collapse is larger than the period of time that followed and it shouldn't be disregarded as just some primitive footnote in history.	1

"I disagree. Console exclusives is what separates the companies and hardware apart. If exclusive games are a thing of the past then their is no need for a PlayStation, Xbox or Switch. Everyone will become a PC gamer.

"The part where they're talking about the initial rollout of the SNES in North America hits home. They mention something about how expensive it was for the time, and how the state of the US economy in 1991 meant it was probably the only ""toy"" the average American parent could buy their kids that year. Took up the entire toy budget.

That happened to my family. Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there, 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old. My parents had a single present for the 4 of us, the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World.

It was one of the best gifts of all our lives, because we had all wanted the SNES badly. We literally played it all that Christmas Eve night and into Christmas day. It's a great family memory that we all still hold with us, now all in our 40's and 50's with families of our own."	1

A similar demonstration of the dropping magnet is a solid metal disk connected to a pivot so it swings through the jaws of a large powerful magnet. The metal disk is not attracted to the magnet, but when allowed to swing through the magnetic field its motion is slowed and almost stopped. If a series of closely spaced slots are cut into the disk and the experiment repeated, the disk swings through almost unhindered. The slots disrupt the currents needed to generate the opposing magnetic field.	1

True.  In college I wrote a 25 page term paper and in error turned in the draft with a bunch of typos, grammer errors, run on sentences, spelling errors, etc.  The first couple paragraphs were fine so when it got retuned  it was graded 'A+' with a 'Good work' handwritten by the professor.  Obviously ( and luckily for me ) he didn't bother reading past the first sentence."	2

Jerry, your videos are some of the most instructive on the internet. My top 3 favorite Youtubers are you, Gotham and Daniel Naroditsky. Gotham teaches you how to understand broad, overarching concepts like a master. Daniel teaches you how to understand the fine details like a master. And you teach us how to realize what master-level thinking even looks like. Seriously. I studied tactics and positional chess for years and couldn't advance past 1200. But your Beginner to GM series totally revolutionized the way I looked at the board.

i got a cool idea, maybe have space pirate raids on your ship, in order to keep track of them, you would need to use your ships cameras to see where they are heading, possibly trying to cut off specific parts of the ship with doors in order to allow you to get there in time to take them out (if there is combat), they could probably take a couple slots per chest if they get to it then retreat to their ship, maybe its always flying next to your ship while you are being raided. this could make flying through the world pretty dangerous as at any point pirates could come and raid you. maybe there could be a whole security system that enemies have to get passed, or maybe they could cut your power in half making you unable to escape until all are gone, it could really make the game incredibly fun.	1
"A BIG tip I have to give programmers is to avoid micro optimizations. As a coder it's generally very easy for me to sometimes fall into a pitfall of seeing a piece of my code and trying to optimize it into oblivion.

If you have fun, then power to you, coding is a hobby after all, but if you're just doing it to save those precious 2ms, it's not worth it by any means, you can do so much better stuff with your time than spending a couple hours optimizing a system for a negligible boost in efficiency."	1

"I found this very interesting, and as someone with ADHD-I, I had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it.

It brought up so many points of interest. With in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution, ADHD is considered an epidemic of our time, and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking. From the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses. As time went on this idea continued but in a different way. By the 1920's there was a drive towards raising the standards of living. People were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked, and live in the suburbs in a house, get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style.

But like he said in the talk, this type of trend doesn't work anymore. Styles of life are so divergent and it's obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women aren't going to be stay at home mom's and many can't. Actually during the 60's many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life. And as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living.

As for ADHD it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child. I believe ADHD is both a cause and symptom of behavior, but not always both. Take your eyes for example. You get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly, so you get prescription lenses. You now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription. And no one asks why.

No one asks why are you like this, how did it happen. Or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it. Yes and no. You can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions, but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met. Becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors. Your nutrition, your genetics and your life style. Actually  some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight, by changing their diet and their habits. For instance a child who stays inside all day, watching TV and playing videogames for hours, refuses to eat his vegetables and who's parents or relatives have had glasses, may develope near sightedness.

So in relation a child who has been mentally watching TV and playing videogames all day, not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity, exploring their real world, developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating, interacting socially with others around them, making constant decisions, based on logic, real feelings, and experiences, and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills, in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner. And it doesn't just go for ADHD. This could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty. In varying degrees of course. But it is believed that behavior (in any form) is partially learned and partially developed. And by developed I mean the way your brain developed. How your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works.

Going back to education you can see why this factory mind set can't work for everyone. As well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts, you find contradiction. Most people don't understand the arts. Most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesn't make sense anymore. Truth is that area of education evolved, but only by those who pursue it, would understand. A big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world. The A grade is the pinacle of that idea.  Do perfectly in your education and you get an A. 

Well this doesn't really work in the art world. You still get graded when you do your work and do it well, but school is for practicing the academics. In art you study academics as well, like art history, art Theory, and your use of a medium like drawing or painting. What you don't get graded on is on the things that can't be measured, like your idea, your creativity, and the value of your work. Though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill. But when it comes right down to it, art isn't about any of this or it can be about all of it. It can be about how others value your work, it can be about how divergent your work seems to be, it can be about how well your work matches a subject, it can be about how well you use methods of design, it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people, and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic (AKA art competition or auction). So in a way it is chaotic to the point people can't make sense of it any more, but it is not inherently measurable and perfected.

It is the product of ideas. And ideas are valued above all else. And yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms, and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty."	2

I feel like the biggest sell for Splatoon 3 is the timing. With the switch being as old as it is now, most people have a switch in their home. So for kids this is a big buy, especially if you haven't played it yet, but all your friends are playing it. I haven't played in a few years and I'm really excited. Just to chill, enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it. It's a lot easier to sell this game to a Japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out. As well as the IRL concerts with their in game idols.	2

Here's what I got from this: This man is a very good lawyer, and still believes in THE law. It was no mistake that he mentioned TWICE that he would never do anything unethical, and he would tell the threats and other bullcrap to stop.

I love your videos! I had one quibble about your SQL solution to #1. If some publishers have more videos than others, then their video durations will affect the mean. You could imagine one publisher with 10,000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos. In this case, the average duration of that one super-publisher's videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers. I think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages. (of course, this detail may not matter in an interview)	2

I feel you on the cost of the pro series controller. I have one of the series 1 pro controllers (which I bought used) and frankly I was disappointed that after I had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel. I had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there, because Xbox doesn't offer their own replacement parts, which I find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue. To be honest I would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isn't going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time. The paddles are nice and all, but I can buy like 3 games for the cost or I can buy a third party controller from S.C.R.U.B. for less and get the same functionality out of it. But hey, to each their own. What I would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab. I would pay extra for that, but as it stands right now, I'll stick with my standard series X controller ??	0

"The people who say ""computer science isn't for everyone"" is missing the point. It is not about whether you like the subject or not. In his whole talk, he is saying computer science is as *necessary* as math/biology/physics etc. We do not learn these subjects because it is fun in school. We learn them because it helps us to operate and appreciate the world better.

Just like how math helps us to understand the purchases we make, the loans we take and the value of the item we pay for, a basic understanding of computer science helps us understand how the internet works, how gadgets communicate, how these technologies can impact our lives. Do not wait for the next Cambridge Analytica saga and pretend to be interested in technology."	1

I disagree, I have never been able to find the deeper meaning in literature.

Thanks<, for the update I always appreciate the insight. <I'm really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long, I had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video. <In as much I would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end. If this is really a bear market rally then Bitcoin is not done going down, just like stocks are not done going down. And if this isnt a bear market rally and the Fed achieves a soft landing, Bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now, but we just have to wait and see.  My hope is that by the fourth quarter, the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause, and then you will see the next crypto cycle start. I have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now. Bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed IMO. Please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions. Despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year, being a retail trader in the crypto market and implementing strategies/signals from Eddie Crypto a professional broker/tradr that has been my mentor, I have accumulated 12' btc! in profits although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits, people who are open to learning from history, will survive Its not that difficult.

I have watched Vikram vedha on youtube in Hindi last year. I don't think, Saif can beat R. Madhwan in acting. R Madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie.

"ML reminds me Big Data's hype few years ago, some senior software engineers were scared of being overtaken by junior if they did not learn it, so they wanted to ""train"" themselves puting an Hadoop stack in every single projects they were working on, until they eventually understood it was not the holy grail of data processing. It just allows to solve some problems (and not all) in a more efficient way than other methods.

I think people in tech industry should all learn what  ML is, what it can do, hardware requierments and what gains it can provide, so  they can know if they really need it. Then, maybe, they should learn it in depth, but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements.

I< appreciate the content you put out on YouTube. I enjoy watching your videos.  I respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public. You may be right on this trade, but if you are right, you better also short the US market as well. Because if the Chinese market collapses, it will pull down the US market with it! Thanks Buddy. Previously Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the $20K and $25K price marks. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If youre a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you dont have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with Mrs. Robin Moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you. I have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 17.03 BTC with 5.07 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market. Her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions. The good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market.

I sincerely appreciate you putting your knowledge on this youtube channel, I found you back a few months ago when I first started my class because I was so frustrated and went to youtube and I happened to find you. I don't understand why teachers don't explain things the way you do, you show us every step while other teachers skip steps and go way too fast. It makes me feel better about myself, because I failed chem class in high school, but have to take it in college to become a Nurse. You're beyond helpful and are impacting students in so many ways!! ill keep using as many of your videos as I can as i make my way through my chem class, you're amazing!!	2

"30:54 The numbers on the screen that were climbing was G-Force (G stands for gravity). 2 G's is 2x gravity. 7 G's is 7x gravity, etc. He pulled over 10 G's which means at that one particular moment he weighed 10x his body weight. The same goes for the aircraft.

I< think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short-term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years, it takes the guesswork out. Next bull runs it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & I need this lower point to get back in, Ive small cash on the sideline I don't like that but I refuse to FOMO in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advice to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mr.Kyle Miller. With his guides and the trade signal, I use in trading, I have moved from having 5.8 BTC to atop 17.3 BTC in a short period of time.

I worked as a high school teacher for thirty years. Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories, which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory. Learning style was just one of many. Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced. Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories (presented as facts) demanding evidence and proof. Ever. Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher. So you had no choice. At least whilst being observed!! I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV. And each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one. God forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience, education and intelligence.	0

"Educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job. Though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition (neighborhood, preconceptions of people, and income) which affects HOW much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil (student). Its fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in. Loved the references you used as well!

I'll never forget visiting the Natural History section of the Smithsonian Institute as a kid with my parents back in the 60's (I'm 69 now, BTW). They had an exhibit there that would blow your mind! It consisted of a wall depicting human evolution where they had probably a hundred or so skulls in rows against a dark backdrop, I assume so the images would stand out better. It led the viewer visually from human's earliest known ancestors with authentic fossil skulls from the most primitive (e.g. Australopithicus) all the way to modern man (Homo sapiens). It was quite impressive and left the viewer with no doubt about human evolution. There it was - in terms of a tangible fossil record, expertly organized - right before the viewers eyes.  ?????	2
Hamza, I just wanted to say thank you, brother. I know this will probably be lost in the comments but from the bottom of my heart, you have given me the tools and strategies to save myself from taking my own life. 6 months ago I was in a very dark place and had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and had no will to live. I randomly stumbled upon your channel and have applied all of the tools, strategies and philosophies you teach since then. I truly would not be here without you, and I am so grateful for you. I now have a purpose and direction in my life, outside of the YouTube videos I watch like yours that have high ROI on my time, I am off social media completely. I'm 17 years old and I'm still at the very beginning of my manhood but to anyone reading this, it gets better. Happiness, peace and prosperity take time, hard work and a lot of effort. But it is so worth it. I am now leading those around me to this way of life and building up my brothers and community. I just today did my first cold approach and it went well. If anyone is struggling with mental health issues or feeling purposeless in life, put in more effort and combat life itself in every way you can, things will get better for you if you choose the difficult path that builds strong men.	2

"I've been an edtech consultant in Beijing for 7 years. I've also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools. There are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive.

The first and foremost factor I would note is the lack of public discourse. This permeates through every part of society, especially education. If you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you, you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner: inquiry and reflection. In education, this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge. Even in history class there's no critical thinking or reflection involved, it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember. 

The second factor of note is barriers of information. The public does not have (easy) access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content, and even if they did get access, they wouldn't be able to recognize it. On top of that, there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as VIPKids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations. This causes market distortion, and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name (E.G. Wonders) and say that's their curriculum without any plan how to implement it.

The third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge. As stated in the first point, most of the population's education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection. If you've been taught not to question things your whole life, how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies?  How can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences? The result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good (or fishing consultants like me for free content).

The fourth factor is lack of foreign talent. There are not enough QUALIFIED teachers to meet demand. The general population would not be able to recognize one either. Many companies hire Russians, call them American, and slap a 200%+ markup on the course. It's up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content, instruction, and meet the unrealistic expectations the ""decision makers"" (sales people) set for the parents.

The final factor is who the decision makers are. Who decides what ""national curriculum"" is? Starting in 2020, private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the ""national curriculum"". This top-down decision making only exasperates the situation. It also permeates throughout the society. I've been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools.  Most of these decision makers are unqualified, they're sales people at best.
I should also mention that many parents have no clue about education, yet influence the schools with their misconceptions...but this is not the parents' fault. Rather, it's the school's fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program.

As for price... it's simply about demand vs supply.  Lack of foreign talent as mentioned before, combined with a desperate middle class (and higher) trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost. They will pay upwards of 200k RMB just to make it happen for their little Middle Schooler.

Unfortunately I exited the market, partially because the clients I had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problems...mostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum."	0

"Emil's perspective is a classic example of the fallacy of zero sum thinking, where shallow thinkers believe that when one side wins the other necessarily losses.  Of course, when it comes to things like chess, this kind of thinking is completely erroneous, and on the contrary when one side ""wins"" both sides win - what is good for one aspect of chess is (broadly speaking) good for chess as a whole.  We should be doing everything possible to broaden chess's appeal, garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity, and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process.  What is good for online chess is also good for OTB chess.  FIDE (and other large bureaucratic institutions) will hopefully eventually recognize and embrace this too."	1
If you want to know the truth about these artifacts and how awesome the ancient Israelites came to the USA before the time of Christ, read the four book series by Stephen M Collins about the Lost tribes of Israel.

I actually feel Nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the Nintendo Switch level. It's the perfect system whether you want a home console, portable or both. They should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks. I'd also like to see more things the Switch could be paired with ..like linking to discord and Spotify and having them run in the background.	2
"Great video!

It may be overwhelming for someone just starting out. But actually, you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these, but mentioning important aspects of each. For example, the part of rules and the events in the game was great, and even though it seems obvious, i never thought about that. I don't make games myself though, but i find game making incredibly interesting, and difficult."	2
When I switched from the iPhone 7 to the Galaxy S lineup. My primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types, its so practical to do things on Android that if you had an iPhone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a Laptop or desktop for. That being said, I still own an iPad that I use a lot, and wouldnt exchange for any other tablet.	2

Ccrypto is off helping to regulate<, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize. And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 16` btc from day-trade with *WTRADE INSPECTS* in few weeks.	1

I like the ecosystem and operating system upgrades that are predictable. I tried android and it was too much of a circus, menus not intuitive. But, I agree Apple does not need to care. I have 4 unresolved case numbers regarding my Air 4 and lots of diagnostics sent in, advisors promised me a response and resolution, but NOTHING, after all that. There are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine. If a low percent of customers have a specific problem, they wont put time into fixing. Instead, we get a bunch of new fluff with system updates (like the new iOS 16 for iPad), that 90% of us will probably never use. Still, I wont go back to android.	0

One day I showed a co-worker my secret and he thought, if 2 pumps of oil is better than 1, then 6 must be amazing! We received so many complaints over his oily popcorn.

When are we as a Nation going back to sincere governance? Elections are partisan by nature but governing is not supposed to be. Encumbants are tasked to address all the needs of all the citizenry. The job of leadership should never be to retard the nations progress when their party doesn't hold the majority. The lies and the one upmanship has got to stop. The victory should be seen as the Nation's, rather than just one party or the other. It is the job of all who are serving to facilitate our progress. We are so much better than what we have been doing. We may have fallen short of our ideal but we should never stop striving. We are guaranteed not to make it if we quit.	0

Very informative. Ive got an engineering degree and had courses like probability & statistics, linear algebra, integral and differential calculus. I have a letter of acceptance from a community college in Canada for Business and Advanced Analytics in a post grad diploma program with subjects like python, sql, machine learning, etc. Im studying python and data science online at the moment in preparation for my Winter 2023 intake. Will brush up my knowledge on statistics, linear algebra and calculus by August as this is a requirement by the program. Back in the days, I had the opportunity to represent our school in Math competitions. What surprises me is that I can still study for 5 - 8 straight hours everyday and sometimes forgetting my businesses as I now leave my managers to decide on their own. What do you think are the chances of people in their mid 40s getting a job without experience as a data analyst or data scientist?	2

"I think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself  in your ""death 
bed"" every now and then . To prepare yourself for this,  you must read 
the 9th chapter of "" The Death of Ivan Ilyich""  again. Just a very short
 chapter where Ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed.  He 
suddenly  hears the voice of his own soul saying:
-What do you want? What do you want?
He says:

-What do I want? To live and not to suffer.

So his inner voice says:

- To live? How?

- To live as I used to- well and pleasantly. 

- As you lived before, well and pleasantly?

Here is how Tolstoy continues:

"" And in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant
 life. But strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant 
life now seemed at all what they had then seemed_ none of them except 
the first recollections of childhood. There , in childhood, there had 
been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live 
if it could return. But the child who had experienced that happiness 
existed no longer: it was like a reminiscence of somebody else. 
As soon as the period began which had produced the present Ivan Ilyich, 
all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned 
into something trivial and often nasty"".

So as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and 
darker.  He basically realises that his entire life had been a lie, he 
lived for what the others expected from him; for money, power and status...He wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no
 way back!

Indeed we all must keep Ivan Ilyich in mind every day. Just consider how
 fast the time goes by.... How much of it do we really spend seriously 
thinking about our lives? Very little indeed... Because it requires a 
certain level of focus and depth, which we don't have most of the time.
That's why this scene is a great reminder. 

So as we make the ""Death bed  exercise"" I have just mentioned, we can 
use the very questions that Ivan Ilyich's soul was asking him.
I think people who live well, deal with their mortality better. So doing
 this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better.

Thank you for this wonderful lesson. I love Tolstoy!"	1

The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.	0

2. Diversify your income. Have a different source (e.g. side hustle)
3. Invest in yourself. Learn something, spend money to make money (e.g. good education, good equipment)
4. Say yes to everything.
5. Move in with your parents. To cut your rent expense
6. Stop buying crap you dont need (e.g. expensive cars, clothes)
7. Track the important stuff. Know your progress and financial situation.
8. Read one personal finance book a year. Just to make you updated on new things
9. Cull your thing. Filter the information you saw on internet
10. Celebrate your progress. Celebrate your milestone to give you motivation to keep going."	1

From my ancestor's folklore:   The Lost Tribes of Judah & Dan  came to  North America prior to the Vikings (possibly on Phoenician Ships).

To absorb what one reads, it's crucial to master concentration. When I started reading in my early youth, my mind would wander before finishing a page. Over time, my concentration improved to a point where I could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought. Activities like chess, reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration. I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment. It's a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline. It's literally rewired his brain. Schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning.	2

Thanks for the great content Shane. As a data scientist myself, who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially, given that my own engineering field had few jobs available, one thing I have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route. If you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline, plus the skills you need as a data scientist, you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot. While traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take, it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth. You end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do, but without the specialized domain knowledge. Coming from an engineering discipline myself, I was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways. I have noticed the same with my other peers who also don't come from the traditional route. I say this because I have met with a lot of non-traditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they can't break through. They definitely can break through and thrive in this field. They offer specialized insights you can't get through the traditional route. So if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities, like linguistics or english, you can become a powerful data scientist (with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied, such as NLP). If you are someone who comes from a STEM field, even better, because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems. All data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science. But what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem, address user needs, and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model. I don't mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off, but I do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well.	2

I was at a trampoline park and after I was done jumping I decided to play some arcade games. I won 500 tickets from one game and got my first rubiks cube from there. It was really bad at maneuvering and would cause so much friction. So I decided to try and move it really fast back and forth and it literally blew into pieces in the middle of the parking lot and scattered everywhere mid-day with spectators around. Safe to say I could never get it back together. I ended up buying several speed cubes and Im able to solve all of them.	0

"yo, this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was, so I feel like I should clear a few things up.

First off, to game devs who are just starting out: don't attempt to do exactly what I did, because it probably won't work out well. And I'm not saying this because I think I'm smarter or better at game dev than you. In all honesty, I'm pretty average and tons of people could've done a lot better in my shoes. But that's just the thing, not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had. Prior to this I'd been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding, so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple. I mentioned this in the video, but I've seen too many comments in the vein of ""wow this was impressive, I would never be able to do this"" which frankly makes me feel a little bad, since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I don't want to discourage anyone who doesn't realize this. 

So I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions. Also, everyone learns at their own pace in their own way, and the rate at which that gets done doesn't really matter as long as you're able to learn what you needed to learn in the end (within reason of course, if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print ""hello world"", then we might have a problem). So even if you have as much experience as I did, there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time. Because ultimately, it doesn't really matter how quickly you're able to learn how to make games. As a game developer, you develop games, and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about, not how quickly you can make them. Of course, this mostly only applies if you're doing this as a hobby, and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay, you should probably worry a little more.

And on the other side of the spectrum, to those who think this video was faked: it wasn't lol. As mentioned before, I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things, arguably the hardest part of developing games. Because of that, the focus of this video wasn't on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling, animation, and how to work with Unity, which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such. But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining, and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol. Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar, but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing, and not when I'm actually making the games. So I just have a weird workflow.

And last thing, to YouTube: why the fuck does this have 500,000 views. did the algorithm break? I can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500,000 views, and this is definitely not one of them. so if you're watching this, go watch someone else's video or something, this one has way too many views already."	0

"Watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games. And after watching animal crossing and Pokmon streams I kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability. 
Now I think I definitely should save up for this one. I like bigger screen option and newer version. Cant wait to see it available on local stores as I just discovered I could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iPhone 12. 
Also I see this as good option when you dont have smart tv to play games on (like my friends) and I even looked up possible laptop connections. So this one looks right up to my alley. Also for when Im willing to give my phone a break or just feel like playing video games (which is something Ive only been discovering few weeks ago)"	2

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts.

Great video Tina! Loving the minimize input maximize output (MIMO) series. My step into the world of data was from a non-technical (biology) background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts. I also resonated with your prior MIMO video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects. I also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem (that helps to make a positive impact in this video) which at the time was a novel thing. I repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it, topics that I used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in.

"My predictions (will edit after I get results):

Reading/writing: 710-740
Math: 790-800
Overall: 1500-1540

Edit 1 (a few hours after taking the test): Feel really confident about the math section, reading was way easier than usual, and writing had a bunch of easy questions but had a few that I couldn't figure out the differences (parts of sentence replacement, not grammar)

Edit 2 (1-2 months after taking the test): yea... I forgot about where I left this comment. Anyways I took two SATs, march 2nd school day and march 12th.

2nd: r/w 750, math 790, overall 1540
12th: r/w 760, math 800, overall 1560
superscore the same as 12th

honestly surprised with reading/writing, especially the reading section. I missed 1 reading on the 2nd (but that was 40 subsection so didn't matter) and 4 on the 12th. 5 writing on 2nd and 1 on writing.

Math I missed 1 question due to not reading carefully and 1 because I didn't know how to do it on the 2nd, but perfect score on the 12th.

if I got the reading section of the 2nd and the writing section of the 12th on the same day, I could have a score of 1590.

definitely not taking the SAT again"	2

When one parent doesn't want their child to read a certain book they can fill out a form so no child in the school can read it. That sounds more like indoctrination than education. Instead of removing the book from the whole school they should just disallow that one student access to the book.  Sorry Johnny, you can't check out that book because your parents said so!	0
Even though the movie is a remake, it's one of all time greats.

I remember watching a documentary about how the area of West Africa had become a dumping ground for used/unwanted clothes from Europe and the Americas; more specifically the North Americas. I was totally shocked and had no idea about this. Villagers would sometimes travel for several miles on foot, sometimes with their kids, to pick through this clothing waste to sell into their communities and earn money. Most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever.	0

"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app"	0

"The only good thing is that Powell seems to be more level minded than predaccesors,  and it looks like he will raise interest rates aggressively based on his discussions. He seems determined to get inflation under control,  irrespective of falling asset values. He might just be the knight in shining armour who comes to the rescue just at the right time. 

Although he messed up with inflation peaking he is the only one who makes sense at the fed."	2
"I used your project-based learning approach from last year's video to learn data science. After 15 months and 700 hours of learning (no online courses, just individual studying), I landed as job as a mid-level data scientist in financial fraud detection. Thank you! This video is spot-on. Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow.

2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful:
1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project. This helped me identify important topics which I had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten, so that I could refresh my knowledge/skills."	2

"I love animal videos, but this one has some flat out incorrect information. Elephants for example do not find humans ""cute"".

"I love your videos! I think you would be intrigued  to hear or perhaps you are already aware  that there is an ancient  record that was unearthed in the 1820's in Palmyra,  New York that was inscribed  in reformed Egyptian by ancient  Israelites. They crossed over the seas from Jerusalem around 600 BC and landed on what they described to be  a narrow neck of land (most likely in Panama). They left their records behind for us and their records spoke of Jesus Christ visiting them after his resurrection.  They multiplied their seed and spread North and South and fought many battles over the  North and South American continents which were considered their new ""Promised land"".  Thus the signs of Christ written with Hebrew origin that you examined would be accurate. There is another record which has been discovered in Panama much like the one discovered in Palmyra, New York. It is a gold set of plates with ancient Egyptian and Hebrew origins as well. Perhaps you could examin the Panama gold plates to see if they are authentic?"	2

If you allow young people to be inquisitive, creative and self-reliant, they will educate themselves throughout their adult lives.

"""An education that prepares learners for life after school"" I would really love to see this. In my country, we are trained to seek jobs, so may graduates are frustrated by the education system. Most of them end up studying by staying in school all their lives as a defense mechanism. Our education needs to teach the mind, heart and hands for us to be a bit more successful."	1

I worked at a large Grocery Store for 4.5 years. Upstairs in the break room they had a soda and two candy/ chip vending machines. They were owned by a local outside company that did a TON of vending machines in this area.. I asked the GM... why not spend a couple grand and SAVE a tone of money, we are a grocery store, WE sell everything in these, and could cut the cost in half and still make a profit. She agreed and walked away.	1

"Great introduction. Question: is it always the case that humans need to input the potential features that are used for classification? For instance, the ML algorithm uses the animal's height, length, and face size as features for classification, with computer vision being used to map images to these features. Do some ML algorithms create these features and features maps automatically, or are these always created outside of the algorithm?

"As someone with the correct clearance I can vouch, just like so many of you, that this guy didn't keep them in a place that meets requirements for storage of such materials. Also, lying about all this  is quick dismissal from your clearance. I've seen people fail to get adjudicated for omission of one piece of information they thought wasn't important. One lost it for keeping in touch with their mother who is from China. Their contact with their mother caused them to lose their TS/SCI. Think about that. And this guy and his followers think he did nothing wrong?
The level of failures here by the former president shows he is ill-equipped to handle said documents.
Now it's just one excuse after another.
Day to day with the people who live in the real world of clearance all know that if we did 1% of what he did, we be effed.

"Just a few things to note about the ""big-oh"" notation discussed in this episode:

In industry, ""big-oh"" notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms. However, in academia, it is a bit more in depth. O(n) is instead used to represent an upperbound (in the WORST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). (n) (pronounced ""big-omega"") is used to represent the lowerbound (in the BEST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). (n), prounounced ""theta"" (without the ""big"") is used to represent the tightbound (used when the big-oh is equal to the big-omega, which is the exact running time). There is also small omega and small o, but those are rarely used.

Also, we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation. So if a problem takes 5n^4 + 3n^2 + 1 to do, we just say it is (n^4). We drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big.

You may notice that earlier I mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation. This is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem. For example, for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix, we have (n^2), since we know that we at least need to read in n^2 values. This problem currently has O(n^2.3728639) which is the running time of an algorithm created by Francois Le Gall in 2014."	1

"Next one should be ""Not alike"" by Eminem"	1
< first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying assets at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy the dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 11` btc with 3.1btc in just 5weeks from day trading with *WTRADE INSPECTS* , in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.	1

@0:45 you could use blender's ""Merge By Distance"" to merge the vertex. I just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one. Saves lot of time.

I felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful, but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked ""why does it look so pretty?"" as a critique for this exact reason. He seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early, because it was too early too tell if their idea worked, yet they had spent time making it look amazing."	2

I have both PlayStation and Xbox, and I like how this competitive climate is forcing change on both sides.

"1) ""Stop being selfish""  Audience first
It is not about you, but about your audience.
Cut length, people won't pay attention for a long time

2) ""Grab me!""  What is the one thing you want me to remember?
No matter what you communicate, make sure you bring across your most important point.

3) ""Keep it simple""
One sentence/paragraph is better than two.
Use simple sentence structure.
Use simple words.

4) ""Be human, write like a human""
Don't try to be a Harvard professor; bring your point across like you are talking to someone at the bar.

5) ""Just stop""  Use as few words and sentences as possible

There you go, this would not have needed 15 minutes."	1

"Daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in Fire and Blood. The Heir For A Day brothel scene really makes me question him. We saw that hes not enjoying himself at all, despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the Gold Cloaks accomplishments with the boys. Mysaria seems to be an enabling force, goading him into his darker tendencies. When he says we must all grieve in our own ways, I think he actually was somewhat saddened by Baelons and Aemmas death. Daemon does want power, but he does love his brother.

Over the centuries, House Targaryen has produced both great men and monsters. Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so beloved, and so reviled in all Westeros. He was made of light and darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains. - Archmaester Gyldayn"	0

Guys..I'll ask again. But may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed. I'd really like to see you to react to them as they are IMPORTANT parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history, shows how their emotions developed and changed over time, and give further context to a specific era /episode of the rise of bangtan. I hope you don't just brush them aside as it's really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like. Not sure why that changed but I hope you'll quickly return to them before it gets too far off. It's a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well. Because it gives you a mental break and as I said, really just gives you more and more context and content. As the series goes on they'll be more and more important to the series too. Whether that's answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldn't be further explored in the episode itself. You've already missed so much content. At the very least it's be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when it's importance hasn't diminished but increased every episode..	2

"Great tips! I would also like to say that understanding logic is very important. My professor really stressed this in my first programming class. He said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error. I think that he is right. Unless you can explain every single piece of your code, line by line, you don't really understand the logic behind it. 

In fact, he makes us go to the lab and the TA asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment."	2

Also, here is my setup during my university years. Hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their college/university years. All the best.

"I think it's down to your mindset. There are some truly trash novels in existence, but you can read something like Normal People and take something away from it, like what your mum said about her crime novels. If you have a philosophical/analytical/learning mindset then any book or even trash reality shows can be good places to apply and challenge your thoughts about other people and contemporary society.

A literature degree is a good place to ""learn to learn"" and really develop that analytical mindset and how to write essays, but this can be accomplished through so many other degrees also."	1

A decisive battle between civilization and savagery has begun. Even in the Second World War it was not like that. Because the two savages were on different sides of the front. It was an inter-German showdown: the Germano-Slavic ethnic  of the Deutschs against the Germano-Celtic French and the English, and the Russian savagery was either together with the savagery of the Deutschs or against them. Now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery. I see the philosophical law of contradiction: civilization is definitely a positive phenomenon, but it is mixed with negativity in the form of shame and cowardice: civilization has hid behind Ukraine and is waiting for something unknown. The memory of civilization's victory in this war will be tainted with the memory of shame.	1

That was such a great video and EXACTLY what I was looking for. I am about to start a Data Science Master's next year and was looking for an overview on how to best prepare for it and you gave me that and so much more, even combined with such a great presentation.

How is your channel that small?

LMAO I dont think yall are understanding Junhos character. Minwoo is his roommate. That is all. Hes keeping whale talk with Youngwoo to only lunchtime because he wants to get to know her.

My biggest tip: if you're a computer science student and have the chance (it was not required at my college) to take software engineering, make sure you take all the software engineering classes you can because that's what you'll be doing.  Most of CS is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use, but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies (Agile which is just old school RAD with more crap to have to deal with, Waterfall, Spiral, etc. etc.) will give you a better idea of what you'll be doing on the day to day.  You'll tailor your data structure and algorithm knowledge to what you're tasked with at work, but the software engineering portion you'll use anywhere you go.	1

Greetings Mr. Taylor, I want to thank you for your tutorial on what a literature review is. My first paper as a doctoral student was rejected because I and several of my fellow classmates came into the program writing in the form of a narrative. Your pin-hole concept nailed it on the head. I used it throughout my Ed.S curriculum and can't wait to apply it to my candidacy cognates. Thank you so much.	2
This video is extremely accurate. I have had such a hard time learning how to be a data scientist. I am in a MS in Data Analytics program and feel that doesn't really provide any real direction. I don't know what I don't know and that keeps me from learning what I need to know. Seeing the path helps, thank you. I would like to say I have struggled to learn R and I seem to be getting SQL quickly and I think this will help my confidence. Getting one language down can help to learn another, just from a confidence standpoint.	1
DAMN, im trying to start a business rn, and being aware that I have to learn stuffs to be able to handle it, and I just got overwhelmed by all of the videos available on your channel. You are amazing! This is my first video, and thank you in advance, you're gonna be a big part of my success!!	2

I'm a programmer and game designer (and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days), but when it comes to art I just shut down. I'm genuinely awful at the art part. So I've always teamed up with artists. Problem is I then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that it's wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect, and it suffers as a result. Eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what we've learned.

I sincerely appreciate  the knowledge you share. If you have been closely watching the crypto <or even invested in it, chances are that you are wondering whether the latest bear cycle is over. The truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the long-term. Despite the heavy outflows, Bitcoin still managed to promptly recover, this recovery demonstrated Bitcoins strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions. Could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery? The obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take, it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy. I have been trading with Boston Webers signals and strategy for 3 weeks which I have been able to accumulate 10.8 btc with his signals. Hes a trader i believe everyone else can also work it..	2

"McConnell's ONLY goal is to become senate leader again. Why listen to him? He acts only in self-interest, not for the good of Americans he's supposed to be representing.
I think he cares who is in the White House, not for Americans' interests, but he cares -like all narcissists- only about how that president would impact his power. 
McConnell has refused to do his job for years by sitting on bills that Americans want passed and refusing to act. In fact, he has been smugly crowing about it. 
McConnell, like Trump, is very angry that he lost his position. His only focus & concern is getting his power back.
He has been in congress way too long. He's secured his millions. His days of ""glory"" are over. He should be removed from office."	0

More ram being allocated to game devs is nice, but it doesnt solve one of the biggest issues of the Series S which is the bandwidth of the memory itself. Also more ram doesnt really mean higher frame rates, but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see LOD culling. It isnt going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60, but it might allow a stuttering, inconsistent 30 FPS to hold a more locked 30 FPS.	0

This is the reason why I prefer stickered cubes, the alternance between colors and black (kind of like shadows) make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool 3D aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself, which with a stickerless cube is just not possible, it just seems like one big cube.

Edit: I guess what I wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which I dont really like."	2

Seneca suggested to his friends that instead of reading ever more widely, we ought to focus on the works and authors that really inspire us.  Most readers don't do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things they've read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them.  Seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection.  And in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose, re-reading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same, if you pick it up again after a few years, you're a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way.	1

"Excellent resource Sir!
Can you please explain all the sub fields in AI/ ML/ DL like NLP, computer vision etc. & any other major part that I don't know even. 

In software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers. Like for web development frontend technologies are same html, css, js. For backend one may choose a programming language (php, node js, asp.net) and a database. 
Again for mobile developers they may choose Android, IOS or cross platform (React native, flutter) with database knowledge, APIs & basic knowledge on how web works.

My question is in software engineering one may become a very good software engineer even he only concentrates on web or mobile dev, can an AI/ ML engineer pick his career in his filed of specialization like only NLP engineer (knows very less about Computer Vision) or Computer Vision engineer (knows very less about NLP)?"	2

"Hi everyone! I realized I didn't actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games (that's why ethical monetization is my specialty now). So for sure, there's data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions. It also encompasses monetization and systems design - though I wasn't formally trained in monetization design before joining (it's actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first). Monetization design encompasses things like battle passes, loot box designs, game ecoystem design (hard currency to soft currency, what resources are tradable and purchasable, etc.), designing events and seasons (what content should be available, how is it distributed, what does progression and rewards look like in an event, etc.) and ofc the pricing of it all. We also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones. We often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction, purchase regret, MAU, revivals, etc to get a sense of this. 

My role today though focuses on a broader list of things, not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well! I made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out :)"	2

"In 2005, Members of the?Viennese?art group?Gelitin?(including M. Puletta, Corroni Fali, Razzoli Caputo, and R. Calizone) finished erecting a massive, pink, stuffed?rabbit?with its entrails spilling out, on the side of the mountain. The final piece was 200 feet (about 60 metres) in length and 20 feet (6 metres) high on its sides. The group did not only expect people to observe the art work, but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top. The work, titled?Hase?(German for ""hare""), often called?Pink Rabbit, first opened in 2005 and was expected to last until 2025, though it had almost completely decomposed by 2016.

"*SOME PEOPLE STILL ASK, ""WHY ARE THERE STILL APES (OR MONKEYS)?""*
It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works. Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes, and from that, due to their lack of education, they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans. That is not how evolution works, but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology.

They might just as well have asked ""If dogs are descended from wolves, why are there still wolves?"" Or even ""If Americans came from Europe, why are there still Europeans?"" Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves, so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes. 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys. Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches, apes evolved the ability to swing, arm over arm, from branch to branch. Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment. For apes, that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it. At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests.

Had environmental conditions remained the same, we would still see forests covering the whole African continent. However, conditions did not stay the same; the climate became drier. As a result, forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands, the African savanna, with just a few scattered trees. The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct.

Then, about 6 or 7 million years ago, one population of apes split, with some of them opting for life on that open savanna. All apes are capable of walking upright, they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time.  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them, walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking. Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly.

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity. by about 4 mya, our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis, femur, knees and feet as modern humans. That gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel. They did however, retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened.

The apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change. They became the ancestors of today's chimps and bonobos. Those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes, and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them. It set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us."	0

My favorite creature ever.  I was on a crab ship in Russia.  I was the green horn so I had to empty out the pots.  I was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden (it was lighting in a cup) so I could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals.  One day there was an octopus in a crab pot.  I tossed it a live well. Came back once everyone was off the deck.  Was gonna take it to the chef. it softly wrapped itself around my arm and I felt like I could see the fear in its eyes.  I couldn't do it.  I took it over to the side of the ship, held it over.  It looked down, looked back at me, let go of my arm, and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water.  AMAZING CREATURES!	2
"I know at least 5 ways to deal with them:

1. Never take their words personally. Always have this suspicion in mind, that they do not wish good for you, so you shouldn't trust their opinion of you.
2. Don't compete with them. It is futile and drains your energy.
3. If they attack you, stay calm, indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment. The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative.
4. Don't become them. If they are negative, be positive. If they lie, tell the truth. If they speak behind your back, speak to their face. Always lead with example, because they might not simply have the skills to do that.
5. Do not trust them. Don't tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you. Keep your distance and value your boundaries. Protect yourself."	0

Everybody, you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds. I have done this in California many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa. It takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach. The next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains. You can even grow it as a houseplant but beware, it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy. If you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in. It likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt, crumbled rock, and sand in a very hot place where it's occasionally watered. That's what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce. Mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years. Please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun. It would be a cool school science project to do with kids, the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not.	1

Hi Brooke! I've been watching your videos for a while and was able to score a 1560 as a junior! My subscores are both 780, which is causing me a dilemma because I want to go into engineering/CS. My total score is at the 75th percentile or higher for almost every school I'm applying to, but my math is at the lower end for my intended major some places. Should I retake to get a 790 or 800 or will it not make much difference?	1

"When I was in the pyschward for 3 days, I just stayed in my room the entire time. It just basically felt like a hospital that you weren't allowed to leave. 
-Screaming at night, yes. 
-Patients standing in the corner for hours without moving.
-Some would randomly start urinating while walking the hall(since we were all nude under the hospital gown)

The room I was first placed in was at the end of the hall, quiet, big, and I was alone. But after 3 days I was put in a room half the size, with 3 other people. And one of them would go HOURS saying, ""she knows"", over and over and over again until the sun would set.

Rest in peace Henry, and fly high with the angels ?? ??	2
<<Thanks for the update and keep doing what you do. My journey in the current market has taught me a lot of lessons, at the top of that list is that it never pays to live above one's means. I have managed to grow a nest egg of around $600k to a decent 7 figures in the space of a few months. Sad to say but a lot of us have poor money management skills. My 2 cents -get an advisor to keep you accountable and aid you make better decisions, Marnell English has been helping me a lot, all through my journey. I find it better to pay a little bit more for peace of mind than worry about money or market trends and still get >burned.	2

"""If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution.

I don't think that Dickens' shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional, spiritual, and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood. While he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art, quite an achievement, he wasn't able to heal emotionally. It's usually easier to deal with such things in abstract, intellectual and artistic ways. He was in many ways driven by his demons, and that can, surprisingly, take you very far in life, but it doesn't make you a better person. In fact, the success may militate against real change.	0
The fact he can do all this without seeing what he's doing is absolute gold.	2

"It's also worth noting that the primary assumption behind DRM is that people that would pirate a game if there's no DRM would legally buy the game if there's DRM.  That's a really absurd assumption.  Most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all, so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer.

And DRM gets cracked in only a few months, so the pirates need only wait anyway.

DRM does only one thing, and that's punish the people that legally buy the game."	0

"So, a bonsai could theoretically become a normal, huge tree when planted elsewhere. But the question is, is a tree happier when it grows way bigger? Or is the tree happy when its small too? The obvious answer is no, the tree doesnt care. Another answer would be we have no way of knowing. People like to assign emotions to things, but a lot of the time those emotions are just self-reflection. 

People assign the wrong emotions to animals too, even though we know animals can feel emotion, people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly. This happens all the time. 

So even when we find out trees can experience emotion (and some evidence already suggests this) we would probably still force our own perspective onto them, like we do now.

What we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do, with the conditions they are given. Are they satisfied being the tree that they are? I dont think trees know this concept. I think people shouldnt anthromorphise their idea of succes and satisfaction onto plants. In fact, people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who dont need it. The trees definitely dont need it either."	0

my mom used to play one of these with me!  ours was growing a vegetable patch.  you would till the soil, and make the rows, then planting the seeds and naming each type of veggie as you went, then covering the seeds with dirt, and then rain falling over them all and sunshine shining on them to help them grow TT u TT  very good childhood memories indeed.  these were great to listen to, thank you so much for sharing and triggering a lot of us in the best of ways.	2

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts.

I'd just like to point out that Odysseus' sleeping around was necessary for his survival. If a powerful goddess like Circe or Calypso wants to have sex with you, you don't have much choice. If you reject them, it could spell doom for you, or your loved ones. Horny gods punishing mortals for denying them sex is a recurring theme throughout Classical Mythology.	0

"Rook's: can move in straight lines left and right or up and down but cant jump over other pieces
Bishop's: can move diagonally as far as it wants as long as there is no pieces in the way of it 
Knight's: the only piece that can jump other pieces and can move in the shape of an L 
King: can only move 1 time in any direction is known as the most Important piece but also the most useless 
Queen: can move as far as she wants in any direction as long as there's not a piece blocking her (small edit she is also known as the strongest piece on the board)
Pawn's: Pawns can move forwards 2 times on the first turn but only once after that on following turns and can only kill moving diagonally forward if the pawn reaches the opponents side of the board you can substitute it for any of your former pieces lost i.e if you lost the queen you could bring the queen back by getting a pawn to the opponents side

"Emotional day.

Haven't seen a Newcastle side play that well (against Man City no less) in a very long time. 

Gutted but grateful to get a point in the end.  Just a heroic team performance. Could single every player in the starting XI out for praise.  Just so proud of all of them.

As for City, I'll just say I clapped as soon as I saw De Bruyne had played Silva in on goal.  Just phenomenal football.  I mean, at times during that match, it was terrifying when City had possession.  A wonderful side and a wonderful manager."	2

As you can see we are already in August and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na?ve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from LIBERTON CORP would advise yall to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren't sure about.	2

One of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesnt mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca. But orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt. They might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since theyre known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets. Just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so	2

i'm actually in an English major and English is not my first language (it's Spanish) and yes reading classics is really overwhelming especially if it's not your first language, at least for me what it helped me was start with short stories or poems so you can go slow with unknown words. Also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors. Another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally, when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine.??	2

"I had, and experienced, this same experiment in a high school physics class in 1959 as we studied pendulum motion. The teacher of that class was a PhD physicist taking a two year sabbatical from a national lab. His demonstration also included a lesson in the difference between what we say and what we believe. Each of us sat on a high stool as a shotput suspended from the high ceiling by a cable was brought up to within an inch or two of our nose. He asked each of us, ""Do you know the laws of pendulum motion."" Our response was of course ""Yes."" Then just as he released the shotput he said, ""Know we will see if you believe them."" Most, but not all sat still as that eight pounds of lead rocketed back towards our noses. Only a few ducked away a the last second. That was 63 years ago. I remember it like it was yesterday. Sadly, today that teacher would not be able to do that experiment (or any of the other amazing things he did in that classroom.) The lessons are to structured, preprogramed, and rigid for creative teachers to inspire the young minds and imaginations of their students. Plus the specter of liability would be the death of any imaginative and creative teaching."	1

Jungle: Jump higher and get much lower fall damage (can build special sorts of bases, I guess), but -1 heart overall. Structures: Aztec Temple and village on trees
Desert: Loses less hunger bars over time

Swamp: Their potions are more effective and lasting + they don't need to kill blazes to make potions, but they have -1 heart in THEIR region. Structures: Giant witch hut
Islanders (live on their own island) : Faster swimming on boats and themselves, better fishing efficiency, but the isle is little and not much land is fertile (that makes them invade others) Structures: Seaport / Dock and Coastal village. 
Snow: It is very cold there and people are brutal. They are -2 heart s in the beginning, but for every kill they get +1 heart (that makes them an aggressive, unstable society), but they can eat only meat (because they probably have never seen vegetables) Structures: igloo village plus Viking fort

I really wish they would beef up the storage on the S for it's current price. A 1tb XBOX X is the same price as an S with a 1tb expansion, makes it way less appealing. Granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the S. Overall I feel if it wasn't for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture. As it stands there's not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel. Hopefully production ramps up for PS and XBOX so we can leave last gen behind.	0

Gaz is spot on in regards to Xbox' marketing. It is an Xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either non-existent or incredibly limited.

Yo estaba viendo cada vez ms factible que el Nintendo Direct fuese el da 1.

Aunque, a saber, incluso siendo la  semana del 12, puede que sea cierto y estas semanas las completen con Treehouses de otros juegos como Mario + Rabbids o Sonic Frontiers.

How can I make my model to make prediction based on the test dataset given to me? Or how can I adapt my test dataset to conform to the training dataset in shape in order to run my program?"	0

I read mostly non fiction books on random topics that interest me. Currently  reading a book on artists and architects. Since lockdown been watching a lot of documentaries on artists and galleries. So I got a book on the topic unfortunately its about 700 pages. Which almost put me off but out of pride I couldnt give up. Only to become fascinated by how all these buildings that were built for people, are no longer there. So who do these objects serve? This book was written in 2017 with an international look as  these creators (to encapsulate both artists and architects). In a series of interviews have to explain their method. Some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space. If I understood correctly each creator seeks to capture and reflect this moment in time for future generations to understand their time.	1

Thanks for sharing! I am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to, since SAT scores are all relative. Since I score a 1500+, it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99%. I think the part about scores being inflated because schools don't have to report bad test scores since students aren't submitting bad tests scores makes sense. However, I do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the U.S. World News Report requires a school to report at least 50% of its students' scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings. Thus, more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots!	2

Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work . So guys don't take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ????	1

"Hello sir, thank you for your videos. It really helps from the beginner of the video which you have listed in data science playlist. ?? 
The model in default method is 99.65% in train and 99.4% in test. Whereas gamma method will lower down the accuracy of the model from 99.4% to 75% therefore it has explicit shows the gamma method is unsuitable for the scenario however the regularisation has improve the train set to 1 and testing set is retained the best accuracy of model. 
Yet, kernel parameter as linear has also provided a good accuracy of model.
Thank you for your guidance."	2

"It's two different things; to start learning and to make your first serious game. When you start learning, if you go straight away to make your ""dream game"", it will likely be frustrating, because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game. Creating a copy or a ""remake"" of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn. When I started learning Unity, some years ago, after doing a few tutorials I decided I would create a ""remake"" of Duke Nukem 3D, using some of the assets of Duke Nukem Forever and remaking the first level of the game in Blender, this was so that I could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project. It took me, I believe, 6 months to finish it, it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game, and yes, it played terrible and nothing like the original. But the amount of learning I did thanks to this learning project was really a lot, I don't think I could have learned faster other way. Another point I would mention is: learning to code: I think was the most important thing I did. When I started making games my game ideas were limited to what I imagined I would be technically capable of implementing, after I got a good grasp of coding I feel and I know I could make anything I can imagine, given the time to do so."	1

"I worked with a marine biologist studying cephalopods. He had one big tank for octopuses and one for crabs, their favorite food. One morning he came in and found that one of his octopuses had pushed the lid open on his tank, crossed the floor and climbed into the crab tank. Soon it became a common occurrence. He decided to give the octopus a mild shock when he found it in the crab tank to deter it. Within days he came in and found the octopus had still gone to the crab tank, eaten it's fill, but then climbed back to its own tank to avoid the shock.
They are amazing animals."	1

Self-Healing Concrete is on paper a really good idea.

"1:03:08 since we are talking about mines I wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines.

Now I understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines (which I love because they leave a large impact on the world!) But it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often.

That is why I thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future.

There could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts (or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is FAR later into development.) You could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts.

The way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks.

A MAJOR issue with this though is how the camera system would work... I could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however I feel like that might not fit the game. (I wouldn't have an issue with it but others may.)

Of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldn't work when trying to make mineshafts I think.

Edit: I guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground.

Another thing I thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground... I say that as if it is easy when I actually know hardly anything about game development but I do believe that should be achievable.

But going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldn't which I think would be cool... Of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse."	1

"I'm beginning to lean more and more towards the opinion that the Initiative was always going to be partnering up with a bigger, more experienced studio from the get-go. Maybe they had plans to do this originally with Certain Affinity? (as its been confirmed that massive support studio was working with the Initiative from the earliest days... most likely on a prototype)

But it looks like Gallagher went with his old studio, Crystal Dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier Initiative hires. But is it really that surprising? The Initiative wasn't hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive AAA project... they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead. And even Jeff Grubb once succinctly put it, 'Perfect Dark was never going to be made by the Initiative'.

Pretty sure Gallagher and other high-ups knew, if they were going to make an AAA game, they were always going to need a large & experienced studio to take on most of the work-load. Trying to get that done with a 65-75 person team isn't realistic."	1

"POT FARMER DANCE SONG $$
I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot
You better believe it held a whole lot.
I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame
Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.

I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes
They did nothing but give me regrets.
My mom had arthritis could not walk around
I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.

I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack
 After I smoked some to me it came back.
Soon I decided prices were high
I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.

I bargained for seeds from smokers all around
 Got in my truck and drove out of town.
I walked through the woods where wild birds nest
 Found me the meadow I thought was the best.

I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds
Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds.
I watered at night with a five-gallon pail
 Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.

Seven months went by; I thought I would die
Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky.
At night I went out, in a camouflage suit
 Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.

I hung it up to dry where it couldnt be found.
Came back and got it, when it had turned brown.
I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags
Called all my friends and passed out free drags.

In less than a week my crop was gone
 I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

Housekeeper here! I really thought these were going to be ridiculous, but a lot of them are actually pretty good tips. Some of them are a little extra, like dont go to the trouble of blending up dried grapefruit peel and mixing it with baking soda, just make a paste with baking soda, lemon juice, and white vinegar. Also I dont think flying round while mopping the floors is a hack. Maybe just take off your shoes.	2

"I really believe in everything he has just said. It is important to avoid procrastination guys. I am telling you this because of my life experience. I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely. I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada. It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture. My knowledge about English was probably between 30% and 45%, so I had to invest part of time studying English.  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year, and it worked. I still need improvements, but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language. After having learned English, I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science,  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year, I took that year to study everything about my career. I took my time to study advanced functions, calculus, physics and programming. What do I mean about all of this? You can learn everything you want if you really want to. The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it. I personally do not believe in what the science says about the ""SPECIAL KIDS"". We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want. You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort. I hope you have a great day and I wish you all the best ??. NEVER GIVE UP."	1

Actually I should not say Gibis role plays are out of this world. They are in this world. They portray pieces of who we are, or want to be, or pieces of people we know or want to know, or of people we have met or want to meet, or of friends (or personal assistants) we have or want to have.

Chill Vibes - Lofi hip hop mix ~ A playlist for loving the autumn	2
Brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now.  I remember when I was very little, I had the N64 where I first played MARIOKART.  Then I was later given as a present the Game Boy.  And then I remember later on I wanted the GameCube which I got I think either for my birthday or for Christmas.  And thats where I first played Animal Crossing.  I played the other versions on the other systems as well.  I then asked about a year or two later Santa for a blue DS Lite, and a few years later I got the DS i XL which was a surprise present from my grandma.  And when I graduated from middle school, my grandma got me the Wii as a graduation present.  I eventually also got the 2DS only because it was slightly cheaper and now I have the Nintendo Switch.  I still love them all and Nintendo to this day!  Animal Crossing, Super Mario Bros., MARIOKART, MARIO PARTY, and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day.  And I cant wait to see Super Nintendo World when it opens at Universal Studios!	2

"For some future video you should definitely build like this HUGE base. Just overnight near some big clan bases and have him be the only guy claiming to have built it by himself. With turrets, and those missile things on top and have him talk shit to the clans that come by saying how their bases are puny. Something like Hans and Franz talk ""Look at your puny base, it's nothing, you're nothing"" Maybe get the clans to try and raid his huge base with lots of turrets and stuff. That would be pretty funny. But you would need a huge base that is already built and able to paste in easily."	1
There are a lot of unique aspects to this video that I really enjoyed, the small sample of languages, even the hunting reenactments.  Native American cultures are so interesting and diverse, theyre just endlessly fascinating.  I hope the native languages will always be preserved, theres always resistance by children, especially teenagers, to adopt the more conservative aspects of their parents culture.  I remember listening to a Navajo radio station near Window Rock, AZ, and when the required traditional song was finished, the young DJ said thats enough of that (bleep), the tribe makes us play these!, then put the latest rock back on.  This is universal, not specific to any cultures, kids around the world always want whats new!   When they eventually have children of their own, theyre glad they received the traditional culture and want to pass it on.	2

I have watched Vikram vedha on youtube in Hindi last year. I don't think, Saif can beat R. Madhwan in acting. R Madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie. But Saif doesn't look innocent at all throughout the trailer. R Madhwan's smile was enough to make Vikram vedha a thriller movie.	2

Working on railways messing around with circuits for a living I hate troubleshooting when it's something simple we've just overlooked. Last fault I had that I was there for fixing was literally a diode being the wrong way round. Cost 4 fuse, hand tracing and belling all the connection points before finally we found the diode was the wrong way round 2 hours later. It's always the last thing you check. Love seeing this kind of content when it's an easy fix	0
I'm in 4th year of my CS studies right now. Unfortunatelly, I needed to realize all of the stuff you mentioned on my own. I feel like in some cases it can be a little bit late. I just hope somebody would talk to me about this at the beggining. I would say to all new CS students: 'This will be harder than you think. But the balance is the most important thing'.	1

Trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors. <It's a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries. For investors, what's probably most attractive is the possibility of life-changing returns. Don't worry, you're not late to the crypto party. We're likely still in the very early innings, leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market. If you're new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert. I have learned from alot of Youtubers especially my mentor Gerard McDonald, who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately.	2

I feel really sorry for whomever made the second game. They sold themselves short. I mean, you don't owe it to the developer, but it would be really cool if your worked with them to make it a full release. If they're interested. Also, could you give these devs a shout out?	1

"Hey Linus, a good trick for streaming lights: bounce them off the wall.  Much easier on the eyes, and a nice softer look.
Also, for indoors, I'd recommend a hyper-cardioid mic (looks like a short shotgun) like the Audio-Technica AT4053B."	2

"After reading comments I agree I felt ripped off, so I decided to search for ""fattest giraffe"" and there are many copies of that particular photo, with a few that have been squished or spread to make it look even fatter. Yet there was also one sitting in someones hand. Suspicious I know.  But I was more amazed to find a very overweight tiger, one animal I would not expect to get fat. Also huge prairie dog. and a very fat horse. Some animals labelled morbidly obese could turn up more."	0

"The OG Rubik's Cube was set up to be basically ""temperamental child"" proof. Like you demonstrated, you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle - but it's also super unlikely to pop or corner-twist during normal use. Non-cubers often consider a cube ""broken"" if it's popped or corner-twisted - I remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin corner-twisted it.

That comes at the expense of having almost no corner-cutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn., but then again it's not meant to be their Speedcube (the Rubik's brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though, but for different reasons)."	0

"Today, I made fried food with Cheetos!

It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!

The first talk was great. Solo developers can get caught up following professional project management methods but forget the factor of individual motivation. E.g., it might be faster to first deal with the most complex problem, but making small wins working on art or marketing along the way helps you to stay motivated.	2

I love how she's confident enough to put forth her views about the current issues and struggles of women and how she's able to relate to and understand them and then throw light on what the world has probably been doing wrong and comment on that. All of her thoughts and ideas and opinions are so down to earth and genuine that they just touch your heart and I really appreciate her efforts of making this world a better place to live in by promoting valuable projects and regenerating the idea of gender equality amongst the youth and the older generation as well. So, good job. :)	2

"This lecture is awesome and really inspiring. I've been a fan now for years now Lex, and I'm really happy to see your success. I just wanted to point out that I believe your analysis of ""One Shot Learning"" re: human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base. The learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling, sitting up, and standing up. This process takes usually between 1 and 2 years. This time (and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it) is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible. The process can be accelerated through coordination-specific training on the part of the parents (which occurs quite often). Errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road (e.g. requiring knee replacement at 55) Bipedalism is pretty complex, and is way harder than quadrupedalism, which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim."	2

"Ive had a rare form of chronic bronchitis since I was little. I know my disorder is probably going to cut my life short, but I love every day that I get.

This song is so sweet in a sad way. It makes me think of when I was younger and Mom would bring me a cup of chai tea (she said the caffeine would help my head and my chest). Every bit of the lyrics seems like its about something special to my memories.

I was in the hospital a few months ago and I was so scared to go to sleep. I wish nobody had to be this sick when theyre still young, but its somehow a little bit comforting to listen to this. Its all the thoughts I couldnt put into words.

Thank you for making this song. Im so glad it exists."	2

"Great video again, Marko you did a great job ??

Sadly The Netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos ??
In addition I can tell that after the Fukushima nuclear incident in March 2011 the EU banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second Chernobyl incident.
The thru regulations Coal was stamped as dirty and Gas was the second best option after Nuclear power.

If we go back into history the North European countries (the Netherlands also) build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages. Since there wasn't a need to change and Gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created. Now there is need so the Coal and Nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need.

From my point of view these things should change:
- Nuclear is the way to go
- Create a military security perimeter around Nuclear power plants
- The western world shouldn't be working with Russia nor China for Energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability.

Furthermore, the ECB cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0% intrest rates, the financial unstable countries (you call them PIGS) Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain and with this structural inflation problems. Russia knows this and the ECB messed up big time.

Last but not least, the EU but also the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan need to stop applying QE, start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years... if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable.

Thanks again Marko"	2

My favorite xbox series accessorie is the PDP Media Remote. Ive had it for about 6 months and its great especially for the price. Got it for 10$ on sale on amazon and they are i think 20 or 25 now. Worth every penny, unlike the series 2 i bought. Its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones, however the price is still to much. If your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for 150$ if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished.	2

"Yes theres ambiguity in role definitions. In my previous company, I worked as Data scientist. However I hardly did any data science work. It was more like a developer work where I was assigned to test and deploy the ML models in production. I could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services. Trouble shoot real time issues. But did little of ML. Then I changed my job and joined as Data analyst. Here I do little of analysis, SQL etc and more of ML like developing models and fine tuning them. Cleaning the data, feature engineering and feature selection. 
I would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science, what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project. They lack quality data, if they do have data- accessing and compiling the data is another issue. After aligning with multiple departments as single man army, you are expected to give some magical results. When results are satisfactory, you will be asked to deploy them. Here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing. Somehow you drag the project. Later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production. And then after all of this single man army efforts, management doesnt see any value in it. Just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution. They are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it."	1

"Truly inspiring video. The presentation is truly flawless, and the few frames of Minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game. I love how you used pocket edition, because its unique and different than most Minecraft videos being published today using PC or console versions of the game, and I really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out. Also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles. I really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base, as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them. Also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding. If you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay, we can find that the player is holding a torch, just like the many around his shelter. This means the torches around the base has just been placed, and shows how you can move forward in life, no matter how dire the situation may seem. In the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area, and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what. Also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning, showing how even if someone is in their home, they are never safe of the dangers outside, and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety. I also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape, which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls. Not to mention the way the player looks out the exit, as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them, thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there, and how even though you may be small compared to the universe, the impact you make can change the world. Another very symbolic part of this film is the ending, where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the player's dedication. It also is in a slightly smaller frame, and black bars replace the outer edges, which show that even though you try your best, there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey, and how much different it could have been if you have done something different, which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of Minecraft as long as possible, without itching ones testicles. The background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt ""blue"" or sad about ending, but still proud of what they accomplished, and is hopeful for what is to come.

A really poetic performance, really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls. I can't wait to see more work from you.

"I don't have a Series X yet, and although Series S is a great console, the fact is all digital is a no go for me. The reason is that I have a good collection of XBOX 360 and XBOX One physical games, and some of them, such as older Forza Horizon or Forza Motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to  license issues. So the only way of playing those games is using the disc. I would be happy with a Series So with disc drive, but as this is not an option, I'll have to go with the Series X.
Another point is that, although GamePass is great (I had it for two years and experienced great games, including Halo Infinite), I think it is a bit too expensive. If it was $80 per year, as the Live Gold was, it would be a no brainer, but at $15 per month ($180 per year) I think it is too expensive. You can use that money and buy over 7 AAA games on physical or digital sale for that price (assuming an average cost of $25 per game)."	1

"OVERVIEW:

1) Study the various roles in data science by researching and asking people and figure out what is best for you.
2) After you a role, study the JD for that role in various companies & check what is needed in order for you to qualify for that role.
3) Go on linkedin and study the profiles of people who are already in that role.
4) The coding is not necessarily the first thing that you need to learn.  Studying the theoretical/ conceptual part first is suggested.
5) After the concepts are clear now learn coding and try to work on data
6) Work on a project ( Kaggle is a great place to start)
 
Nope we're not done here:

7) Prepare for interviews

Im a Brazilian student struggling if it's worth applying to the US. 
I did a in-depth research, some mock sats at home, and have a strong sympathy for certain American colleges' education structure as compared to Brazilian or European universities, which I'm fortunate to have the citizenship in both places. Nevertheless, if I do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years, Id have to eliminate one of my options, whether USP in Brazil or EPFL in Switzerland due to the amount of time set into both. 
While balancing my studies for the local admissions test(Fuvest-USP), the EPFLs entrance exams in French, and a few ECs, I obtained a couple of 1550+ scores at home following all the procedures as time-monitored tests. I judge my English as near-fluent since I have been taking classes since I was 9. Above all, I have a strong passion for physics, mathematics, and technologies(mainly AI related to physics research).
I also would be prone to take SAT II, and possibly AP exams, as well as the TOEFL to sum up with my 9.6 out of 10 GPA.
My main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest - math or physics with computer science.
I have participated weekly in two educational NFOs since I was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work, some calls, and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher, which I loved; I had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until I started piano lessons one year ago; I have been taking English and French private lessons for 4 years; and played varsity state-level soccer, being the captain until the pandemic started. I acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live I life I won't regret, however, I awfully believe that my extracurriculars aren't good enough for top 20 schools and I'm inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education, but entirely different from what I've expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that I also have in history and art. 
Back to my financial means, I'm entirely grateful for the opportunities that I already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of $25,000 per year from my parents. By converting my mothers income to USD(~$35,000) we would qualify for 100% financial support from need-based universities, and those would be my goals.
My question is, am I a strong applicant for Americas A-1 universities undergrad or have I lost my chance by not investing in a passion project?"	2

This is a common misconception. While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.

Edit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier. Just wanted to clarify that."	0

"Notes:


Animal cell

Eukaryotic cells, with membrane ,organelles and nucleus containing DNA that calls the shots 
Animal, plants, fungi and protist
Flexible and squishy membranes as oppose to plants, allowing the creation of cell, organs and tissue types

Cell is like a city:

On the surface:

Microtubials: made of long protein fibers: Cillia (tiny arms like in lungs and throat pushing the mucus up) and Flagella (whip-like tail like in sperms), Protozoans, move with Microtubials instead of muscle tissue
Membrane: Selective permeability: monitoring coming in and out like boarders

Inside:

Cytoplasm: water+nutrients
Cytoskeleton: scaffolding made of protein strands, Centrosomes: infrastructures
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): network of membranes like a highway system 

The smoother parts of ER are like factories: 
containing enzymes (proteins) producing lipids, 
detoxifying substances by adding carboxyl to make them soluble in water, 
storing ions like Sodium used for energy

The rougher parts of ER have Ribosomes attached to them:
Synthesis and packaging of proteins

Ribosomes: float freely, assemble amino acids into Polypeptides pushing the protein chain into ER where it's bitten off and sent to Golgi Aparatus

Golgi: made of membranous layers: the post office for packaging proteins, cutting them into hormones, combining them with Carbs to make molecules
Vessicles: the packages with Phospholipid walls

"The video is great especially when you talk about the Agency business model!

Although I disagree about some other business models generalizations. For example, on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once, it's an option, there's revenue sharing, pay per sale etc.

From dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle (costumer).
The margins game is highly variable and that's where some people get ahead of others.

Nevertheless, selling ROI Services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency... Website, content and all."	2

I was genuinely afraid, I thought the game would be identical to the second, or even worse!  But this Direct definitely made me change my mind!  There are crazy news, the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games, and I love it.

The new character sprites look so good! Seems like youve come so far in such a short amount of time. With the amount of detail and complexity in not only the art, but the code, I assumed you were a seasoned game designer and programmer when I saw your 1st devlog almost 2 years ago. I was impressed then and even more so now watching Chef RPG progress and improve as you continue to grow as an artist and game developer. Its not only fun but incredibly inspiration for the rest of us indie game dev. I cant wait for the next update!	2
I've owned both and the Series S has a special place in my heart. I love the X but unless you're rocking a TV that supports 4K120 w/ VRR, the Series S is just fine.

He was detained for a short time, and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule, he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item, and during his autopsy, it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived. Some suspect that he was beaten to death. Historian and YouTuber Mark Felton researched this very subject about Himmler in a YouTube series called The Death of Himmler I cannot recommend his videos enough. His videos remind me of what the Military Channel once was before it became the American Heros Channel, if anyone remembers that.	0

This painful plateau of economic misery will continue for years. There are too many forces propping up the market. It'll never get back down to the average person anymore because the institutional money will grab much of the property before it does. There are also so many more options for homeowners than simply selling now. Sideways for years to come and the next generations go downhill. Hopefully it was worth the greed of the asset bubble the Fed created.	0

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with Kerry Pickett insights and charts.His been one step ahead of other analysis..	0

if MU fans really want the glazes out, you have to hurt them where they care the most --- money. boycott the club commercial sell and their sponsors, lower their TV broadcast views/stadium attendance/social media activity ratings, etc.  all these together will brought down the valuation of the club, really weaken the glazes's position and help potential buyers. protest along is meaningless. before that, i doubt anything will happen.	0

Albino snakes are probably one of the most common snake morphs seen in captive bred individuals. Theyre not hard to come by at all. Also, all the snakes you showed had black eyes.

Trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors. <It's a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries. For investors, what's probably most attractive is the possibility of life-changing returns. Don't worry, you're not late to the crypto party. We're likely still in the very early innings, leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market. If you're new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert. I have learned from alot of Youtubers especially my mentor Gerard McDonald, who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately.	2

"Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program, got into a program, and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies. It was shocking to see how bad it really is; oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant. My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue. The answer was that it was truly both. I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-doctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future. It's so lovely to see John talk about this, specifically on the tech sector!

The question of who committed the crime is immaterial. That is starting from a wrong premise and does not conform to justice principles in this investigation. Rather the question should be was a crime committed, what crime had been committed and what does the law say about committing such a crime. Then justice should follow. The law does not say unless such a person is a former president.	0

I loved my 7th and 8th grade math teacher, his goal was to make the class love math. He said he loved when people failed, and he also only checked homework because the school system made him. He did the best he was allowed to, and this goes to show that you shouldn't blame the teachers, you shouldn't blame the people who designed the school system [around 150 years ago], you should blame the people who *keep* the school system the same, never changing it to suite modern needs more. Modern schools are near identical to ones over 150 years ago, which were designed to mass produce factory workers. Let that sink in.	2

"Part of the problem is millions sold their homes to large companies like Black Rock instead of to actual families. Those type of companies want money so they jack up the rent and never sell those homes to families.

"??    *these are some most important and  precious advices every one should read*  ????

*1.* _Take risks in your life. If you win, you can lead; if you lose, you can guide._

*2.* _People are not what they say but what they do; so judge them not from their words but from their actions._

*3.* _When someone hurts you, don't feel bad because it's a law of nature that the tree that bears the sweetest fruits gets maximum number of stones._

*4.* _Take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you, it takes even your last breath._

*5.* _In this world, people will always throw stones on the path of your success. It depends on what you make from them - a wall or a bridge._

*6.* _Challenges make life interesting; overcoming them make life meaningful._

*7.* _There is no joy in victory without running the risk of defeat._

*8.* _A path without obstacles leads nowhere._

*9.* _Past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay._

*10.* _You can't have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time._

*11.* _If what you did yesterday still looks big to you, then you haven't done much today._

*12.* _If you don't build your dreams, someone else will hire you to build theirs._

*13.* _If you don't climb the mountain; you can't view the plain._

*14.* _Don't leave it idle - use your brain._

*15.* _You are not paid for having brain, you are only rewarded for using it intelligently._

*16.* _It is not what you don't have that limits you; it is what you have but don't know how to use._

*17.* _What you fail to learn might teach you a lesson._

*18.* _The difference between a corrupt person and an honest person is: The corrupt person has a price while the honest person has a value._

*19.* _If you succeed in cheating someone, don't think that the person is a fool...... Realize that the person trusted you much more than you deserved._
I 
*20.* _Honesty is an expensive gift; don't expect it from cheap people._

"I've used this a few times and it works really well! My only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers. Even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a BUNCH of anecdotes to loads of questions. The first time I tried it it was very lengthy and didn't really work. Now I start by saying what I am doing currently, the job or education I did before this, a summary of my other industries and qualifications and THEN I a future statement about where I want to bring my experience/skills.  ""I am 26 years old, currently a team coordinator at ___. Before this I was studying __ and volunteering at ___. I have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector!"" 
I don't know why but I always start with my age ??

After this they usually ask why you want the position. This is where I suggest spoon feeding them with the ""I know you are looking for someone with xyz..."" statement ??"	2

As a sidenote, we don't know if prime factorization is NP-complete and we don't know if it's P either! We only know it's NP. I'd be surprised if someone discovered it to be in Pand also if someone found it to be NP-complete, because this would mean quantum computers would solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. If someone proofs that prime factorization is not P, and not NP-complete, we'd finally know once and for all that P != NP (via Ladner's theorem).	1

"This vocalise of ""Ave Maria"" was composed by Igor Krutoy especially for Dimash.  It goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional song(s) is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power.  Nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as Dimash, the greatest vocalist I have ever heard in my 80+ years on this planet, and I've heard some really great singers along the way, and in every genre ever conceived.  What a blessing to experience this voice, this incomparable talent.  btw: Very nice reaction."	2

"Expand to see important notes for this video. 1) This video, as stated in the description, focuses on general functions of biomolecules. The biomolecules: carbs, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, can all can have important functions in the body.  *This is a video about the general function of biomolecules. For your dietary needs, consult with a dietitian or medical doctor.*  2) We mention the popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules. As we mention, these are basics. There can be more elements (such as sulfur for example in proteins), but we wanted to identify *common elements starting at the building block level.*  At the building block level, *some amino acids lack sulfur* for example. It's not just sulfur. For example, there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen. The popular CHO, CHO, CHON, CHONP mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level. 3) Since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates, one character for lipids, and one character for proteins - unfortunately, when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type, it isn't designed to show a specific type. We received a great point in an email though that, since our little lipid character is a triglyceride, this can be confusing when naming lipid functions. For example, at 3:52 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane, it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there won't be any confusion as we do not want to imply that *specific* lipid type makes up the cell membrane. [Phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well]. We plan to explore creating individual, detailed videos on lipids, carbs, and proteins where we can show different types.

Say what ever you want, but Boosie is the epitome of a southern raised Black man. He has real qualities and he stands on it no matter what.

Been a huge fan of Boosie through his whole career, I wish nothing but great things for him. As a Louisiana native, it gives us hope that one day that type of success can be achieved!	2

For anything dealing with the actual nature of reality, time to visit your local metaphysician... unfortunately, any statement from a metaphysician can only really be speculation and language games, so alas..."	1

"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app"	0

I used to work for those online tutoring companies. They wanted native English speakers and promised you $16 but would dock your pay for things like yawning on screen. The pace was insane. I was fired for not smiling enough. The burnout rate was very, very high, especially because you had to get up at about 4 am to do it if you lived in America. The kids would be really young - the youngest I tutored was 3, too young to understand anything at all - and be in pajamas and finishing up their dinner, so like the last thing they wanted to do was stare at a computer and learn English, especially because the age range seemed to be 5-7-year-olds. Sometimes they would pick up the laptop they were on and just run around the room with it and the parents would give us bad marks for not keeping their child engaged enough. It was a really horrible job for both companies I worked for.	0
The sound board works but not every time. You need to get sounds of NPC's idle talk, getting run over & pretty much reacting to what players are doing, your first give away is the fact you are looking for players (i get it, it's to pretend to be an NPC) but just pass by some players.	1

The owner in this episode is such a sweetheart, bless his heart. It's sad that some of his staff take advantage of that. I'm so glad Gordon came to help and I hope they clean up their act and kick it into gear.  I really hope that after Gordon leaves that Dean will continue to put his foot down and have the restaurant and life he deserves. To be completely honest, the cook showed promise, but he didn't show up half of the time when he needed to and didn't listen to Dean and wants to say Dean is a bad man...that's ridiculous. Dean put up with Orelio (cook/chef) thinking he can do what he wants (mainly Dean's own fault) and so now that is what he expects. I would have fired his ass a long time ago.	1

"I remember seeing your first devlog 2 years ago and just knowing it wasn't going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right. I haven't seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i don't think i will ever see anything like this again. If i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you. I cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month. Awesome work keep it up and best of luck!

17:40 Also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies, and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesn't enough! Also to whoever concepted the humanoid characters awesome job! Looks dope!"	2

Wonderful video!  I  first got into <BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying sats at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy these dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever, I have made over 9.5  BTC with 2.4btc in just 5weeks from day trading with Expert MR Jacob Carlson Crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.

Just wanted to comment about how much I love these videos. Last year while applying for PhDs I was searching for passions.

Now I have a PhD studentship in soft robotics and plan to use SINDy to help with modelling and control and honestly think that giving machines brains may be my future work too.

If you are going to start a vending business, giving customers the option to use cards will increase your sales a ton. Fewer people carry cash, especially in small denominations.

"10:00 this is an extremely hard coding task. It deals with a custom data-type, implies the iteration and verification of the end. I wasted 40 minutes and didn't resolve it, all the solutions I have found, include flattering with a separate method, than iterating and len() verification. And the task is formalized in a way, that next() and hasNext() methods should be enough to do the flattening (which is again more difficult).
I am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune-500 company coding interview. Comparing this with the ""explanation of the gradient descend"" is like chalk and cheese."	0

Thanks<, for all you do! I like your truthful coverage. Mad respect for educating everyone. BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, but I think we should be educating the newbies on what to do aside holding rather than discussing about the dip. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage is understanding, Charts wont guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down. Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader,   Ruby Benally . I made 8.5 BTC from the recent crash in the market within a period of five weeks.	2

"After going through and seeing the user interface, the ""download"" button is not as prominent as the ""proceed to purchase"" button is obvious.

1. Polygon! All meshes are made from polygons. Within games polygons must be 3 sided/triangles, though typically in animation and 3D design polygons are 4 sided. 
2. Code! All it needs is code so we can start giving the ball commands on what to do and when. 
3. 3D in almost all scenarios will run slower in comparison. Almost anything can slow down a game though, an 8k 2D image with an intense shader/material will put a lot more stress on the game than a normal 3D model."	1

I use Unity every day, and it's great. It's like an all-rounder game engine. Unreal is more of a 3D, artist-focused engine. So choose Unity if you're more of a programmer and want to make cross-platform and various games. Choose Unreal if you only want to make 3D games, and you're more of an artist. If you're still not sure, just go with Unity.	2

"As someone who got away from an unknown ""prophetess"" who shared a similar view, it's scary that he actually has a following. While it is hilarious, and admirable someone trolled their book burning, I find it scary.

"Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how eloquent, polite, professional, and serious both the interviewer and interviewee are. I'm just in awe at how well the conversation flowed. Especially, I was amazed by how well Blake Lemoine speaks. He answers the questions effortlessly with almost no hesitation, pondering, or searching for words and he does so without any of the common idiosyncrasies we typically see with people who are for the most part extremely intelligent, but inexperienced at doing televised interviews.

Kudos to Emily Chang and Blake Lemoine both for having such a civil and compelling conversation."	2

I'm surprised by the environmental score going to Apple. Apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most Android phones.

"In my opinion, Elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future. It's encouraging, in a sometimes discouraging place to be. I'm sure there are many more like him on our planet, and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live. Rather, than some who are here for their personal gain, and greed, not thinking of the future past their own. Something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world WITHOUT our approval as a whole, and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets, letting drugs go rabid, people starving including myself at times, because the cost of food is out of reach, allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have, allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you can't afford your own apartment. Something must be done, both at the state & government level. 

I have trust in Elon. He may not have all of the answers, nor should he... Just the fact that ""truth"" matters to him more than anything, shows that you can get onboard with his ideas, and plans for a better future for us all. Christina"	2

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 3.5 BTC from day trad!ng with Liberton Corp insights and charts. His been one step ahead of other analysis..Stick with BTC/ETH/BNB/ADA/MATIC...	0
Love these tips! Being confident in interviews is so hard. Mainly because we are so hard on ourselves and the stakes are high! The #1 tip about being comfortable in the space is HUGE. Being present helps you get out of your head and stop any spiraling before it starts. Visualizing beforehand was mentioned, but it can be a total game changer. By visualizing yourself answering the questions and killing it in the interview, your brain will be trained for that scenario.	2

Gamescon had quite a few games that peaked my interests but that sony edge controller was the most intriguing. Looks like we can hot swap joysticks which could be a fix to combat drift.	2
"My take... Probably messed some up...

1. The cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form Your finger than the heavier side, so that finger moves faster towards the COM of the cane. This causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass...
2. The phone is not evenly weighed, so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize, right...? Well, the same effect is observed when spinning a brick (it fell on my foot... twice... while I tested that) that I played around with. I believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brick/phone is in the middle of the whole object, so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the COM will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum, the spin is easier. On the other hand, spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy, so this state is unstable. The phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate, which is a more stable state (rhyme unintended). The same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending Your hands out, which causes You to decelerate.
3. This one is a bit of a troll... I tested deuterium water and distilled water... and the distilled one produced no (less) effect! Its not the water that is attracted to the cup, its the stuff in it (ions)!!!
4. The cereal contains some iron, which is magnetic. This makes it attracted to the magnet... Maybe, but what is interesting is that water and glass, fex, are pushed away by magnets... its diamagnetic! Anyways... Maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into? I did not observe one, I do not know, but I did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor!
5. Hot air rises. As the hot air creates a rising bubble, the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away. When it gets light enough, it slowly flies up...

Hope I am correct. :)

Great news! I passed my 2nd interview yesterday and got an offer letter by email today even though I was told it would take a few days or up to a week to hear back.

"I come from Indie to AAA studio as game programmer. 
If there's something to add, every discipline has it own depths on knowledge, perfecting stuff like design pattern, design principle, code conventions, CI/CD pipeline, Automate Test, etc. (for programmers) is needed when your project grow. That come along as other department.
Maybe at the first time you think you won't need dedicated Project Manager that handling all daily task and scrum, but when project get larger, team gets bigger, you will need that one and for indie who grow to bigger company usually overwhelmed with this kind of situation. Heck, if you love making games later on you won't even touch the project as too many things on managerial you will handle on. 

If you just started game dev, make sure that one day what you want to become is pretty clear, will you create your own studio? or work for big companies? which discipline? what studio ? (this can be matter as a programmer / artist who need align their technology / artstyle).
There so much to prepare and I can't write all of those question in one post.

Hope everyone who read this post can consider your journey even harder, not make you scared of gamedev but thinking more critically because this could be your future work and huge part of your life."	1

"I think for the price (I got mine used for 180 euros) paired with a nice 24"" 1080p IPS monitor the Series S is very good value. As you said I have found Forza, FSX and Halo to run great. To your point regarding storage space I also agree that just having space for the couple of games you are currently playing is perfect. On previous Xbox consoles I would find I'd fill up the HDD with loads of games due to Game Pass and a few other purchases and never got time to play them properly.

Oh lets not forget the Series S is a fantastic emulation box more than capable of running many consoles."	2

"After 2.5 years, I am returning here to say that Ive just accepted a job offer for a good salary, and my IT journey started here, from this video, in November of 2019. This was my first source of information, when I got back from work (being a cable tech), and typed Python full course or something along those lines. 

Of course, back then, a lot of concepts like classes and inheritance meant nothing to me, and this video perhaps wasnt the most beginner friendly. However, I was so sick of my job and I absolutely saw no growth in doing cable, where the salary cap for a technician was probably IT jobs base pay for the most part, so I decided to Google every single thing I dont understand. 

And I successfully changed careers."	0

For example, I work as BI Analyst, normally with Power BI, SQL and low-code platform (PowerApps, Automate...)

instead most of the tools which I work on, have integrated machine learning tools, as image recognition, NLP, classification... with a few steps and a clear suscription.

In fact, I get my job because they demand for a person who knows analytics and have data science knwoladge so that can advice on the use of these integrated tools.

A note for your souldiers revisit, while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues, the fire temple, a late game area, is still prone to a lot of  crashing when saving at dragon swords, it was 50/50 every time I saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not, didn't get any crashes anywhere else so I'm not sure why that area specifically is so problematic (it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch)	0

Ccrypto is off helping to regulate<, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize. And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 16` btc from day-trade with *WTRADE INSPECTS* in few weeks.	1

The interviewer even told me ""very nice"" after I said my spiel as outlined in the video (I didn't end with the question because I'm not THAT confident ??). At the conclusion of the interview, they told me I wouldn't know a decision until 2 weeks later, but they ended up offering me the position two DAYS later. Thank God I found this video!!

"I think anyone who has spent time working in a modern, agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant: we no longer plan past the next quarter.  ""Supply chain bottleneck"" is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show, and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict (cerveza).   The system is brittle by design, because it's so much cheaper that way.    Nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos:  it's a huge engineering lift, it takes 20 years to pay itself off, you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts, machine them, weld them, then certify and maintain them over a period of 40+ years.  Instead we've been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home, gutting workforces, funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain / skill loss as the old timers machinists retire, but hey, we delivered a lot of value for shareholders.   And now the chickens are coming home to roost."	0

It's very easy to stick paper into the slit (encrypt your message using the public key), but without knowing the combination of the safe (the two prime numbers the key is composed of) it's impossible to get your message back.

If someone can correctly decrypt a message you encrypted with a public key, they proved to know the two prime numbers."	1

"We are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments. But on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and that's what Laura Vanderkam says in her talk.
I used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling.. but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that I'd have more time to study. Yet every time I would rush through, I'd be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me, making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights. All I was left with was more sweat, frustration and muscle pain. So I decided this was not going to do it. Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature: the rain, the sunshine, the wind, the smells of life, everything, listening to the city or the birds. I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks. I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day. It's my favorite thing to do now. 
Making a priority list will make your life better. Especially the relationships and self categories. Taking time to just be present in the moment and live. Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead. 
Or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through Facebook, watch a TED talk. You won't feel like you've wasted your time after that. 
Thanks for the inspiring talk. I'm getting back to work now. Time to review my priority list."	1

Andriod has alot of features that you might not use everyday but when you need it they are always there whereas with iphone you basically just can't do what you want. I was on the fence of switching to iphone but when I learned more about ios I think I'm good with my andriod device. The splitscreen feature is useful to me I can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using maps(I used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when you're short on time) whereas with iphone I can't do that. Also, MKBHD is using an andriod phone while complementing iphone which just goes to what they actually prefer to use even tho they have multiple options to choose from.	2

"Solo Dev here, and the part about marketing is totally true.  My game (SHAMELESS PLUG, LINK ON MY CHANNEL TRAILER) was a complex effort where I learned a lot about animation, music, and sound mixing.  Some seemingly simple things, like sound settings and zoom, took the longest during development, and when it was all over, people who played my game said it was pretty good, but it was hardly even seen by anyone.  The marketing thing was something I never considered, so it's going to be a focus with my next game.  I made a game, and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey, learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places, and that I naively expected Steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there.  If anyone's wondering how accurate this video is, the answer is somewhere around 120%

Great video too.  Editing was great and music was well chosen."	2

"Pretty good summary! I disagree with the statement that it isn't a science, however. CS researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments. In fact, that's how I'm spending my winter holiday :) Like, ""If I solve this problem with method X instead of method Y, I get a more reliable answer."" Of course, if you only have empirical evidence (i.e. it's been tested in the real world) your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof. So in that way, it might be that some problems CS folks tackle are ""scientific"" empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics. But some big, popular branches of CS like Machine Learning and AI advance primarily through empirical, rather than mathematic, evidence. Whether mathematics itself is a science I will leave to the writers of dictionaries :)"	1

What I need going forward is a Nintendo Switch successor that is backwards compatible and offers improvements to previously released games. I need to play Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Torna over again in true 1080p or at 1440p whether it be 30fps or 60fps. I just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed.

Yes if you think you might want to add multiplayer / co-op you really should do it from the start, suddenly you have to validate everything your players are saying they are doing along with replicating all the right properties without flooding the network and your animations and simulation has to be on point since players will be doing crazy things that AI just wouldn't / we would give AI a pass on	1

I remember watching Michio Kaku's shows on discovery science as a kid, he made me interested in science and I probably learned English from those shows, and if I traveled back in time to close the TV then, it's likely I wouldn't go back to being an engineer.

It's funny how some people can change your life without them ever knowing.	2

3:49 This is actually one of traditional games in my country. But normally we use an oil paper or newspaper. First we glue every end of corner each other, then we make a little hole at the center by using a needle. Then we blow the paper from the hole until it expands like a pillow. Finally we light every corner of the pillow paper at the same time. It will fly and look like a Japanese fireball ghost in the sky	1

"I'm going to comment this on every potato video:  To simplify the de-starching of your potato, whether it's for chips, fries, hash browns, or whatever, use a solid-bottom salad spinner.  Fill it with water, swish your potato pieces, lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until it's clear.  Then dump the water and spin the potatoes.  You will get them super dry in just a minute.  Then you can lay them out on a kitchen towel or paper towel, but this will save you paper towels, because they will be dry.
Of course, there is no reason you _must_ use my technique.  After all, you are the Johnny Depp, of your Potato Prep.  Enjoy!"	1

While I do enjoy my College Biology class, having this information in a visual format like this gave all that abstract lecture information something to stick tothank you so much!	2
I love speculative biology, but this project has one problem as I see it. The idea is presented that these amphibians wouldn't transition to forms of exothermic metabolism. We have evidence that both crocodilians and dinosaurs could change from warm-blooded to cold-blooded and back again. Birds, being warm-blooded reptiles, show the transition from ectothermic to exothermic lifestyles. Why wouldn't amphibians do the same over the eons in one shape or another?	1

I <,have watched you for the past 2 years, and found you to be really down to earth and no frills. Congrates mate and stay real and love the fact you share your loses and wins. Good luck. Bitcoin price recently completed a two-month surge that resulted in a price increase to over $25,000; consequently, investors are now concentrating on the cryptocurrencys next target price. Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price, particularly in the last four weeks. The loss has become the primary cause of several firms liquidation issues in the crypto industry. I think the direction is upward movement, with a bit of silence before the storm, agree it's boring for the past few days. a good strategy for hoddler'ss moving forward would be to buy now and trade not to just seat like a baby seater and watch, and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn, the rise will surprise everyone. As for traders, you make money anyways, in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions. If youre a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility. Well good-news you dont have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with and trade with my investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore trade signal and the rest will be a good history of profits for you. As i have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 15.03 BTC with 3.09 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market.

Another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually ENJOY game design or not.

Where I live I have NEVER seen a betting shop close down - one round the corner from me has been open for over 50 years. There's a constant stream of customers going into these places and even with internet competition they still seem to thrive. Betting shops is where I would strongly consider investing it. Cigarettes is another one, BAT share price just goes up and up. Warren Buffet loves the tobacco industry and who can blame him with those huge profits. Even with all the bad write up about the dangers of smoking people still do it as it's so highly addictive.

"I nearly got 100% completion with this game. Had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief. It took a lot of patience, but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped. It was frustrating. Usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet, so you had to traverse large areas. Trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me. 

Now I'm stuck on some backlog games, so I don't know if I'll ever have 100% completion. But maybe one day...."	0

I'm beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity. There's place of brashness, boldness, creativity, fear, light touch, nimbleness, anger, bluffs. It is a beautiful game, rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics. It has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one, how many more things are possible in a game, how far ahead can pieces support each other, how deep and far-seeing ideas can be, and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions.	2

This is remarkably clearly communicated. Almost unique. Every single wording, every sentence, is chosen with a purpose. The examples are very descriptive. Needless to say, the topic is a bit complex. It is adressed, subject to an almost perfect understanding of exactly when the apprentice finds some topic extra difficult. Imagine having a teacher like this when being in formative years. Sometimes in life, you happen to encounter people with an above-human talent to communicate complex matters in an accessible way. Simple enough but not to simple. It is important to recognize this and to cherish those rare moments.	2

The universe is fractal, therefore the same rules that apply to a solar system must apply to an atom (except at faster speeds), otherwise the universe would collapse in disarray and conflict. Empirical observations of the micro universe are as good as the equipment utilized to collect them. If one observes a particle (planet) around the nucleus (sun) with a shutter speed equal to one revolution, it would register at one position only; 1/2 cycle would result in two opposite positions. At higher speeds more positions are collected and the vibration (wave) function starts to reveal itself. What is missing in our science at the particle level is the inclusion of the interaction between the particle and the energy dissipated from the device used to observe it (equipment or human brain).	1

I could never afford these pieces but that doesn't stop me from really appreciating the vision behind it.	1
The reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger. None of their past games have had an open world. Their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations. In this game it's actually one open world so it's the largest open space of any game they created. And they did say that this open world is bigger than Prey.	1

Your take on the Habsburgs is wildly inaccurate.

"I am not convinced. I have done some digging into AI myself, genetic algorithms  and such. From what I can tell is that an AI is in essence a function with a lot of variables, x, y, z, etc. It then changes part of the function, via constants to achieve the goal. If it doesn't match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements.

What I'm getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an AI and a basic algebraic function. Y = X would then technically be a sentient being by that definition.

Finally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an AI the ability to feel pain, sorrow, longing, grief, greed, and the like is terribly inhumane.

A super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans.

I mean just because the AI can out strategize doesn't mean I am going to give it the nuclear launch codes."	1

BTW, reason I am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions. I recently went through google data scientist interview (1 hour tech screen) and to my surprise, the question was straight out ""coin flip"" probability and expectation problem... I was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and I couldn't come up with the answer very easily at first. That was the only question (some resume related question before that, of course) I got in the session. As a data scientist myself, those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally I don't think it'd help to measure one's understanding of stats or technical background. How would you suggest prepare those?"	2

"In the animal kingdom, the ability to hide, disguise yourself, blend in to your surroundings and be unseen not only affords you safety from predators but can also make you a deadly hunter. In the African savannah, Zebra graze on grasses they seemingly disappear into. In the Madagascan jungles, Chameleons change the color of their skin to suit the trees they climb. In the warm tropics, Mantis blend in amongst the foliage as they hunt their prey. 

The Octopus becomes one with the great barrier reef with apparent supernatural ability. Polar Bears and the Arctic Fox disappear in the blinding snow as they scour the arctic tundra. Penguins play, unseen by predators, in Antarctica and the Snow Leopard rules the mountains of Southeast Asia. 

Animal Armory takes a closer look at these fantastical superpowers and the animals that wield them.

"dumb idea: a C.A. video thats literally just exploring life on earth, describing the lifeforms with examples from fictional works in a role reversal way. treating the very real animals like their pieces of speculative work and vice versa.

Spider-Man: No Way Home and Top Gun: Maverick both brought back the moviegoing experience in huge droves as both films became one of the first films to gross over $1 billion worldwide at the box office since the pandemic began. Also, Tom Cruise and Paramount made the right decision delaying this for two years because it's a film that's made for the big screen and everyone knows that.	2

We need more people like Penrose! He is really thinking outside the box. He doesn't put assumptions on all the things he learned, like many smart people still do. We need more people like him, who is curious and ask the right questions. He truly knows where the black spots are in our knowledge. He points them out clearly. We are watching a genious of our time. 200 years from now he will be known because he was one of the few who understood how little we know and where we should look	2
this worked so well, thanks so much for these tips i followed every single step very very VERY carefully, thanks so much!	2

I've got that Azeron keypad. HIGHLY recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal, but especially for gaming. Highly highly. You can even find certain models on Amazon usually. I ordered mine from the factory, for the color scheme and one of the newer designs. (the one on this video is the original design, which I'm sure is still just as phenomenal, but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes, so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem.	2

So glad you're covering this, people need to quit wasting their money on this sauce. It's dangerous, and I don't feel sorry for anyone who buys it, we've been warned so many times now, but with a big youtuber like you talking about it, it helps get the word out!

Comparing the Switch and the Series S is a good way to explain what it is. Both have a more accessible price but the difference is that Series S has a lot more power and features but cannot be used portable in a convenient way. It depends what you need/want at that price point.	1

I prefer stickered on 3x3, because I love the look. Any bigger cubes, the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me, to many that can get damaged, and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying. I would probably feel differently if the stickers from SpeedCubeShop weren't as good as they are, so I would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless, given the option.	0

"Hai Sir, 
Thank you for this video. I dont know even a single alphabet in this subject when compared to  all other viewers. But now a days I hear a lot about Artificial intelligence, ML, DL & DS  around me. So I thought to at least know what they mean. I struck the correct video at the first attempt and I put your lecture in white and black which came to 2 pages while viewing and hearing . The lecture was so crystal clear that me who does not have any knowledge in software (I just use word & XL for my job) has come to know about the above 4 subjects to the extent what you delivered. If I have understood, then the people who are already in this subject  would have got a lot of useful information. Now If I tell to my son who works for a software company about this subject he may feel surprised that how I could knew about this subject. Thanking your Sir once again. I am 57yrs old, can I learn and become DE or DA or DS"	2

One thing this video misses, and probably the one most important thing is that confidence comes from within. You can stand in any way you want, dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king Solomon blush, but if inside youre still insecure the world will see it. Love yourself, know youre worthy, and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside. Dont try and be or imitate someone else, be who you are and love it. One thing this video gets right: Know youre gonna be ok no matter what. Nough said, love to you all xxx	2

Yes, for your sponsor Grover. If you keep renting a product until you reach its retail price, you can keep it forever for a symbolic dollar. Or, if you fall in love with an item before that, you can also pay it off at any point. So the only issue I find with that is why must we have to pay retail for a refurbished  or used item?	1
Thank you again Rachael !   Interviews are always a challenge.  I have often contemplated how I should behave while being interviewed.  It seems that the most successful interview experiences for myself have been ones where I remained relaxed but alert, and most important,  just be myself  .  If you are acting, it will tell on you and be unfavorable.  The person you are talking to is not God, just another person.  Keep that in mind during the interview process.  Always be respectful and honest.  I always enjoy listening to you Rachel no matter what you talk about because your diction is near perfect.	2
Much in the way they did with Spider-Man, It does help to have Fantastic Four cast early so they can introduce them in other movies and shows. That allows them to introduce the characters and have their audience familiar with them without having to do an(other) origin story for them.	2

"That glass pane-beacon thing was neat, I liked that. Though I find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general. I kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam. I know Vanilla Tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me, but that doesn't mean EVERYONE isn't seeming my base just SURROUNDED in beams. Maybe they could make tinted glass function as a ""beam nullifier"" while still maintaining effects? That'd be nice."	2
"A lot of people are missing the reason why Hrithik went in different direction to Vedha's character than Sethupathi's calm & composed. 

Vikram Vedha is based on old Indian folk tale/mythology of Vikram-Betaal(Baital) from Baital-Pachisi. Betaal is described as a creature/monster who questions king Vikramaditya's strong sense of justice. Betaal is little bit crazy, and inhuman (addressing Achara's concern), and that's the vibe I'm getting from Hrithik's Vedha's unlike Sethupathi. They are going more traditional route, and Hrithik didn't copy Amitabh's character from Agneepath, either. 

Honestly, I like the approach original creators and Hrithik took for this one."	1

It's touching to hear Elon talk about wanting to bridge a gap between the genetically unfortunate with intelligence augmentation. My mother has a hereditary severe brain disease that affected her life & disabled her. The impact of her brain health affected my development/life and my brain health. The genetic component also affected my brain health. Currently I'm functionally disabled from it too. It's a constant chronic hell cycle. It's comforting to know someone out there as dedicated and capable as Elon Musk is thinking about disadvantaged people like my mother & I.	1

"According to WalletHub the best state in the country for quality of education is Massachusetts followed by California, according to research released  (January 21, 2019) by WalletHub. The study was part of WalletHubs annual ranking of the Most & Least Educated States in America. This years ranking combined two categories  educational attainment and quality of education  broken down by 20 relevant metrics. Massachusetts placed first in both categories followed by California. 

While the educational attainment category is based solely on the percentage of residents with high school, associates, undergraduate, and graduate diplomas, quality of education includes 16 metrics ranging from quality of public high schools to quality of public universities to educational attainment based on gender and race. Within that category, California follows Massachusetts. Rounding out the top five for quality of education are Florida, Maryland, and Vermont, respectively."	2

"A voice from Cambodia ????!

I came from a state owned school and finished my high school examination with A grade. Then, I enrolled in a state owned university and completed my bachelor degree last month. Recently, I joined a Management Trainee Program to compete with other fresh graduate students in order to earn the top 5 spots to be qualified. One of them was a girl that graduated from foreign countries (she spent 3 years in Singapore and one year in Australia) and I can see clearly see the difference between us in term of languages, skills, and knowledge. Its hard to stay being optimist because in reality students from rural areas in my countries dont even know how to properly use a computer while those in urban areas ace this skill and other multiple skills since they were young. To my knowledge, one of the possible ways right now is to enrich the English language to the disadvantaged students and also creating high quality educating contents in our own language, namely Khmer. Ideally, I hope those students will obtain the proficiency in English language, then study the contents that suit their interests through educational media that vastly available at hand now."	1

"I agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time I think there's a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about: democratization and the experience catch 22. 

I feel like your video alluded to what I mean by democratization quite well so I think we're probably in agreement there. A lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models. I think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boiler-plate enough that it's ripe for ""automation"" using some kind of auto-ml, the sql-like syntax that redshift and BigQuery offer, or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away. This opens ML models up to the tech-savy but non-specialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already, pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and ML-OPs. We still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often it's just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day.

For experience I really think there's a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless self-teaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people. This is where I think we disagree: the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you don't talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience. The largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you. I would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level. My expectation is that you'd see a massive gap favoring employers at 0-2 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5+ years of experience. So while the industry is expanding, the companies aren't hiring juniors, or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program.

Together I think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals. If workers with domain experience (but not a DS education) can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job I think we're going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry. Perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree"	2

Heres a story for you beginners , I went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding, I got a C in intro to Java, okay yeah I did bad but then I wanted to get better so I did some practice over the winter to improve my logic, okay B in the next highest class the following semester, Software 1. Then over the summer I was able to learn so many other languages, Swift, Python, JavaScript. I had all this growth in a little under a year. All Im saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesnt know how to code, and dont think it will get easier. Trust me, it gets easier, do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like (it elses, while for loops etc) to help you gain a feel of how they work. I would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java, as a beginner this is a daunting task for me. So over winter break I made projects such as, modeling a Car in java, okay what functions does a car have, accelerate, decelerate, break, etc. from then I could think of variables, okay what could toggle a car being on or off? Oh a boolean! Oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero, okay thats loop there, with gas level modeled as an int. See things like this slowly helped my logic grow, and now I can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me. Trust me  Im still a beginner as well, but I ended up catching up to the kids around me when I was once behind, and in times when you feel like giving up, please dont, I urge you to stick through it because it does get easier.	2
"Just wanna real quick say that if you plan on being really good at building, this is NOT the only tutorial you need, not even remotely. Being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics, ie what they are and how to execute them. You need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are, have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter, often times even understand things like color theory. There is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video, especially an 8 minute one. But as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great, pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it.





Also if you want to get really into building, I would recommend watching all of Grians tutorials, and once you've gotten to a decently advanced level, watching tutorials from another, far smaller youtuber who goes by Horace - Minecraft. he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft, in my opinion, even better than grian is, though they do build in vastly different ways so there isn't much comparison that works there."	1

I know that you have other things going on, but I seriously miss the regularity of your videos during the height of the pandemic. You, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, Marion's Kitchen, Nicki Positano, and a few others are what got me through the days (weeks!) of quarantining alone and food shortages. The fridge in your old kitchen gave me hope that I  could shop and cook for good food and make it work in my ancient undersized fridge. At the same time, I was unemployed just before the pandemic. I'm now employed again (yay!), but I miss the regularity/frequency of my favorite YouTube channels. Best wishes!	1

I started at 255 in April and I played so badly that my friends made me a laughing stock whenever I play together with them. I decided to subscribe to your channel, put some effort to study openings (I pick solely London for white and either KID or Scandi for black), and in 2 months I went up to 500. I stagnated between 600-700 until August, so I decided to learn more from you, consequently I start winning and 0-blunder games started to be a habit around November. In December I reached 900 and after now I am finally at the 4-digit mark. Thank you Levy! You're such a great teacher!	1

In this case, I saw your B on a5 was hanging and white's rook defending their e2 bishop.  But it's not always super easy for us to figure out."	2

"This thing is also evident in India. Students preparing for NEET/JEE (and for many other competitive exams) who pay lakhs of fees in coaching institutes get a remarkable edge over the students who can't afford to go to these coachings. Most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are IITians, doctors, etc. These coachings provide great facilities to their students, so the results are obvious. There are very few government colleges (of class 11 and 12) in India who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams. 
Also what I have noticed is that it's not just the school that you go to matters but also the kind of peer group which you have. Also, the support and thinking of your parents and the overall society and environment in which live matters when it comes to education."	2

Spasky was honestly the mvp of the story with giving into Fischers demands to ensure he got a fair shot to prove his title even though he was being pressured to win at all costs by the soviet union, just because he respected him. Plus even though Fischer went off grid for like twenty years, Spasky was willing to go out of his way to play with him again. Then to try and personally protest for his release from prison and even ask to stay in his cell to play chess with him, just because he respected his skill so much.	1
I am a landlord and realize I could get so much more for my well-maintained and in a great neighborhood houses. I have chosen over the 25 plus years of owning these homes, that I would rather treat people fairly and respectfully. I did not raise rents for MANY years. In NC, landlords can only raise rents by 5% per year. Because I did not do that, my tenants are paying a few hundred dollars below what I could get with new tenants. I have had tenants for more than 20+ years. We all become a part of each other's lives. I care about my tenants. Please do not bash ALL landlords. Good landlords do care about their tenants.	1

Sir, thank you very much for posting this. I have learned a lot just by watching your video. I also took the important details on my notes so that I can review it. You are such an amazing professor just like my biology prof when I was in grade 12 who can explain everything in detailed and examples. By the way I am from the Philippines and I am having a college entrance exam this May ?? Thank you again Sir for the series of video you've made for biology. I am currently watching them ??	2
I've got my test tomorrow, thank you SO MUCH. You know one of those times when the teachers teach you stuff but then your friend just explains it briefly and easily and you understand just better than the 1 hour looong session. That's exactly how I felt. Anyways thanks again and wish me luck!	2

I lost my job of 13 years in early Aug. I had two interviews with two different companies, I got an offer from both.

"I've always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we, as humans, seem to sort things; it seems like we're much more efficient than many of the algorithms (at least the ones I've seen, which is admittedly few). For example, when we look at all the items, we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once (e.g. ""oh, I remember that was the smallest before I found the actual smallest, so that's the second smallest. Let me put both of them first and second right now, saving myself a re-look""). I know computers are still faster in the end, but I suspect that's because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data (and possibly our brain has a slower ""clock speed""), rather than computational efficiency. Anyone know if that's true?

Has anyone made a ""human sort"" algorithm, so to speak, that sorts the way we do, including our little ""tricks""? (I'm guessing no). If not, are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two, like the one I just described?"	2

"Here's another con: CS is not an easy degree to get. I'm currently a graduate student in computer science and I also teach freshman computer science courses (I'm a teaching assistant so I teach labs, professors give lectures), and from what I've seen, at least 40% of the freshmen entering computer science will be weeded out by the end of the year. Or as Tren Black would say: business by christmas. Also very important: contrary to what a lot of people think, CS is NOT software engineering. You're not just going to be writing code all the time, you're going to have to study algorithms, data structures, formal methods, discrete math, computer architecture, etc. If you don't like math and you're not good at math, you better buckle up and start reviewing or you too will be ""business by Christmas""."	1

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with LIBERTON CORP insights and charts.His been one step ahead of other analysis..	0
The only thing that matters is box office. Hrithik's Agneepath was a box office hit and his Vijay is totally different from Amitabh's Vijay.

All that matters is box office rest people will always criticize no matter if it's actually great.	1

I was watching a detective story from the 1990s and found myself thinking why dont they get out their mobile phone?. Of course, I then recalled they didnt actually have them, then. The younger generations must really find old shows difficult to relate to - much more so than we did. There were far fewer significant lifestyle changes between 1940 and 1980 than between 1980 and 2022, I feel.	0

"Funny enough, the argument that Bitboy's business is ""advice"" is incredibly dangerous for him. Coming from someone who IS actually registered to give financial advice, there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice, and what you can say if that's your business. Needless to say Bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front. Normally, YouTubers are protected from liability because their business (YouTube) TECHNICALLY isn't advice-based. Admitting your business IS advice-based, though, might open you up to liability.

I'm not a lawyer, but I know a bit about the legality of financial advice, happy to touch base if it would help."	0

I am so unbelievably happy, ans I haven't even watched part II. I mean, I know how it ends (maybe), I graduated in it, but THIS is how you should teach physics to students, THIS is entertaining, it's simple but extremely detailed and understandable at all levels, you won't get a class of teens looking at you like you're reciting the bible in latin backwards and then an average C score at the end . THIS is what Physics is, FUN. Endless thinking, endless possibilities, endless learning. Physics is the language of existence and we are just toddlers slowly navigating our ways through learning the ABCs of it, at any given point in time. This is life teaching us. There's nothing better than this. NOTHING. Yeh!	2

"A more cynical perspective on why public (state-funded) education became so popular and important for industrialized countries is because their workers now required more knowledge in order to be efficient. They needed to be able to read and write and have basic numeracy skills to operate machines. If the cost of teaching and training people was passed on to the state, then companies would not have to spend money or time giving their workforce the tools they would be expected to use.

Worryingly, the same is happening nowadays. Many companies complain that people leave college/university and are ""not prepared to enter the workforce"". They want someone else to teach people to be good, efficient workers, so that the employer can make the most of their staff from day 1."	1

"Very good tutorial ! Even if this tutorial is one year old, I'd like to add something. For the inheritance, I think it would've been worth mentioning the ""Protected"" accessibility level for variables. For those that don't know, a Protected variable is the same as a private one, except that the variable will be treated as if it was public for the child classes. It's pretty useful in cases like the one shown in this video."	2

Let's look at this from a consumer point of view, paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing. No big deal, that's just how the business is. Obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console. But for Sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially BRIBE multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay FULL price on there platform instead, because they know they can't compete with it, is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get. And they have the NERVE to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry???? ???? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black ???????? Sony has no answer to gamepass, there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they can't go anywhere else. This is simply Sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from COD. But I guarantee if Sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat, and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldn't leave COD multiplatform. It's apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for Sony ?????? hypocrisy at its best	0

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid
You're never satisfied

Here we go again
We're sick like animals

You're just

I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight

It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide

I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you

Oh oh

Take a bite of my heart tonight

Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess

This wave looks amazing, Im amped to play these and relive the past once again! I hope they bring Koopa Cape and Peach Gardens along the future waves. Those 2 tracks especially are my favorite tracks to run!~	2
Scott and hope are the best couple and they're actually realistic but dangerously underrated	2
Hope they can be friends for a long and happy time	2
Sometimes being an organized individual has its cons when it comes to increased task anxiety in not being able to keep a rigid schedule. Sounds like many others here in the comments can relate as well! Just gotta go with the flow and see the results build up over time.	1

Thank you for citing your sources! Wonderful work.	2
she does the work piece by piece, from the sketch to the nose, the eyes and the mouth, this is how you really learn to draw, this video really is one of the best to learn	2
a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game: ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay. i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well (you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible). i'm very exited to see this games future, so good luck.	2
if anything, I feel bad for Nico. Being so paranoid and insecure that she automatically assumes everyone is harassing her, regardless of what's being said. Even someone with the same name was enough to make her feel threatened. Must be so draining, you know? No wonder she sounds like she's always on the verge of tears. She's also a discord mod, so no surprise there. I hope she gets the help she needs.	0
As someone who is looking to break into this field, as an entrepreneur, and as a husband and a father, you are truly an inspiration. What you are doing is incredible and I wholeheartedly support you. Keep going. You are the future.	2

"When I close my eyes I hear MaxTech. I'm looking forward to seeing what the new iPhone 14's 48mp camera can do, but with rumors of a periscope zoom coming next year, I'm not sure if I'll hold off or not. Also looking forward to seeing if there will be an M2 Macbook refresh announcement in October. I ordered a  BTO 16"" M1 Pro,  but if the M2s will be out within a few months or so, I might cancel it. I have until the 24th to decide. ??"	2

Scott, you make good entertaining shows that titillate the imagination, but you are anything but objective, and are always seeking the grandiose explanation. You know this is seldom the case. Templars, lost tribes, bigfoot. C'mon, dude.	0

Wouldn't constructor theory fundamentally be assuming we know all the base sets of rules in order to be correct? Otherwise it could rule out things that are possible, but they just don't have a truth statement for in the base set of rules.	1

We are already in the big crash, Inflation is a catastrophe. This CPI report is a colossal failure. To bring the housing market to a halt, the FED will have to pull all the stops. The unfortunate issue is that other markets are being decimated.If you want to stay green, you have to rely on a lot of diversification. Currently up 14% and being careful. Still a better deal than leaving it in a savings or checking account yielding 0-1 percent interest.	0

I know you guys are doing more CC Lit, but this is my favorite CC series, and I have read entire novels for the sole purpose of watching two 10-minute videos on them.

"Asking if Data Science is dying would be like asking if engineering or medicine is dying. There will always be a huge demand for these sorts of careers. Tons of people thinking they want to do them is a byproduct of that. But just like engineering and medicine, most people who think they want to be in the field can't really hack it (for whatever reason). If you are someone who is smart and hard working, you don't have to worry about the field being ""saturated."" Most of that saturation is from people who aren't very good or who call themselves data scientists because they completed a mooc or two. There's a huge difference between completing certs and degrees and being able to actually do things in the real world. The wheat gets separated from the chaff pretty quickly."	1

No its not an A or even a B rate movie.....the core cpl went from being a no nothing not worried about nothing , to analyzing what was going on around the world AT THAT TIME  and starting on a journey that i think many of us have been on for awhile. I will not criticize their reactions , too many people right now are right where they were at the start of this movie. Instead , they started to oopen their eyes and see what possibilitys could happen and took the first steps into prepardness. Im as bad as they are about knowing my neighbers , ill admit that , ive lived in this house 25 years and i only know and talk to 2 of my neighbers...and theres like 20 familys up here withen a mile mabey more. Folks , instead of criticizing this film , analyze it and see where YOU stand and how you can help others.	0

"If you would like more information about what happened to families during this time, a great book to read would be Red Scarf Girl. The author actually lived through the cultural revolution and the book is a retelling of what she lived through.

My english teacher actually made a unit covering the cultural revolution. He went very in-depth and explain a lot of what happened. He also had us do an essay comparing Mao and a Dictator of our own choice. It was very informative and I believe that more people should be taught about this dark side of history."	2

Seems odd to create AR creative around satellite tech, since its just for emergencies.

Im 67 years old and have lived my entire life in Mississippi.  #43 is a huge win in that every time I have observed state rankings regarding quality of life issues we are nearly always #50.

Me already having my stories written down in the STAR method, making sure I said I in everything and having my stats on how I helped my previous Company gave me the confidence I needed to answer any questions that they needed. I was also able to dissect my stories to answer other questions that they needed this method is so bullet proof. I received a call yesterday that I got the job and Im so happy I cannot thank you enough.	2

"Things to help you study:

Water: did you know you can only survive a couple days with out it? Also it can help you concentrate
Lofi music: why not? It helps!!
burning incense: OMG, it just puts you in zone!!
Snacks- I find it hard to study on an empty stomach.
Breaks: Breaks are very important if you want to stay concentrated, and if you stretch out your back, you may be lucky and get a few good back cracks!
sleep: Sleep well at night!!!
Comfy space: Make your study space as comfy as possible! (just not to much so you will fall asleep!!)
TURN OFF YOUR PHONE (Unless all you are doing is work/studying and lofi girl music)
Also open up a window, its great for fresh air!!
And lastly your study stuff!!
Now go and study and stop looking at comments!! 
Hope you have a great study time! I know you are woking hard. Be proud of your self. Don't let anyone put you down!! You are strong. You can do this!! I am proud of you!! <3"	2
"For me its simple. When I spend a lot of money on something, the least I expect is that its built to last, and from my experience iPhones and Apple products in general do just that. The moment that isnt the case, Ill have no hesitation in moving on. 

Build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days.. I have a collection of broken Samsung phones for example, not dropped or miss treated, just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use. I have an iPhone 6s and an iPhone XR that work as well now as they did when I first bought them, that gives me confidence that I wont need to upgrade my 13 Pro Max until within reason, I choose to do so."	0

for me, what got my career in coding started was my experience as a student programmer for a company near my university that hired me on basically as an intern. They hired me because I worked for them on my Senior capstone project (fall semester) so I worked for them as an intern during my last semester, through that following summer, and then I landed my first full time job in the fall. I would have stayed with them had they been talking to me and expressed interest in actually treating me like an actual employee.	2

"Hey everyone, 
after some years of experience I know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills. 
A few days ago I had a very interessting, nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years.
The question which fascinated me the most was "" how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier?""
The reason why i tell you this is because I am very exited about your opinion on this topic!Especially the following 2 questions would interest me the most:
1. As programmer, what are/ were the 2 biggest issues youre dealing with?
2. Regarding your programming skills, what would you wish for more than anything else?


Thanks so much in advance - looking forward to reading your answers!"	2

"Tip: for the whats your weakness question be sure to offer a weakness that is not directly needed in the job. 

Like if you need to be very organized in the job dont say that as a weakness. Most people have several weaknesses, offer something that is not directly needed in the job you are applying for (even if youre saying its something youve overcome or youre working on now). You dont want to offer up a reason not to hire you. 

Also be sure to watch your facial expressions - you may be super passionate and or just  thinking ?? but you dont want to come off as angry or frowning (smile every once in a while haha)

"3:55 - Not really, C++ is much more complex than C, you have the standard template library(STL), templates (check std::enable_if for example), different methods of casting (C-style cast, static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast), RTTI (run time type information), concepts and constraints (some kind of traits) (concept and require keywords), range-based for loops, rvalues and lvalues, lambda expressions, std::launder (I don't know what ""memory laundering"" is), and more.

Well we do have some really bad ass games on game pass already and if they ain't planning any new additions this yr we should be good.. honestly it's not a big deal for me personally ?? I run both xbox series S and X which honestly its been more series S than the X. And ps5 so I'm good on games lol ?? dude I have thousands of games already on both platforms ??. So yea and atm I'm back on forza horizon 4 and 5 and elden ring and dark souls 3 and demon souls remake. So I'll be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on GP I'm ok and I'm sure many of us are.. xbox has been really good to us ya know. They take a huge hit just for us to have fun and that's why I love xbox. They truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series S and X and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it. Yeah games on Xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps4 n ps5 ect but still they do good by us with Game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series S n X...  and i don't understand why ppl are shit talking the Series S.... dude I love mine I have 3 of em ?? ??.  And it can do 4k Microsoft already said it does lmao.. and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your TV go to settings display settings and select 4k 60hz or 4k 120hz what ever your TV or monitor does.. and then start a Game... and then take the TV remote and hit the OK button.... your TV will tell you what the series S is putting out to it... mine shows 4k 60hz Hdr10 DD and the games look beautiful and smooth.. yeah it's not as nice as the series X but it's Def not 1080P it's a higher resolution 100% and I don't see how someone can get 1080p by looking at it lol.. 1080p don't look that damn sharp n good lmao... and just look at the ps4 pro specs... the ps4 pro is a 4k correct??.... well the series S has better specs has better hardware... the same or a Lil more Tflops as well... the series is is a Zen 2 which is a AMD 3k series a RTX machine... it will do 4k just not as well as its bigger brother the X...	2

I followed the Olympiad and was floored by David's performance.  There were over 180 teams, each with around 5 players,  so there must have been  800-900 (if not more) players in the Open division.  Not one of them played more successfully than David Howell.  Moreover, his efforts went a long way towards giving England a top 15 finish.   Congratulations David Howell.  I was very happy for you.	2

I got my first Switch a month ago, the OLED edition, and i gotta say its one of my favorite consoles ever. I started with the PlayStation 1, then the GameCube, Gameboy Advanced SP, Wii, Xbox 360, 3DS XL, then really got into PC games, and then stopped playing videogames for many years. So it was a delight getting the Switch specially because of the great games it has. My favorite so far have been Fire Emblem Three Houses, Animal Crossing New Horizons, and Smash Ultimate. Also really surprised with Mario Kart 8 its a lot of casual fun! Well this is my paragraph that no one asked for lol. Great video btw!	2

Whenever I go to a place that doesnt take Apple Pay (doesnt happen too often), its such a drag. Between contactless Covid habits and my getting the Apple Card, Ive gotten so used to Apple Pay that I get seriously annoyed when a store doesnt take it.

"To the person reading this who may be tired of studying but HAS to;

sometimes, before studying, you need to remind yourself what you're doing this for.

you're doing this so you can enjoy your life later.

you could even be doing this in hopes of going to university and partying the heck out of a Friday night.

you'll get there
you can do it.
let's try to make it together, eh?  *smiles and offers you a hand*
 

fix your posture,
unclench your jaw,
relax your muscles,
breath in,
..... and breath out.

""I got this!""

Damn right! you HAVE got this. believe in yourself <3

Now, let's get studying!

Credit to Crystal Palace, that was a great counterattack before the goal, reminiscing of Brentford's 4th on Saturday.	2
"I agree with the Serma's comments regarding Casemiro's age, but this whole ""30 is the new 25"" is very subjective and depends on the player. Luckily, Casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well, and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats. His injury record is phenomenal as well. However, not every player ages like Casemiro, Modric, Ronaldo, etc. Some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30. So, whereas it's objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way, that doesn't mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it (some don't even have the opportunity to do so). Players like Eden Hazard, Sergio Busquets, are good examples of the counter-narrative in my opinion. On his goals, Casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the opposition's box is very good - great aerial ability as well. All in all, Real should be glad that they didn't lose him without Tchouameni already recruited. Good luck Tank!"	1

Wow! I am so glad I discovered Dr. Penrose today. I wanted to refrain from any comments, but I have to say that the Interviewer asked better questions than Dr. Peterson and he seemed to understand what Prof. Penrose was meaning, whilst Dr. Peterson's brain seemed to short-circuited a few times. My view is that Dr. Peterson came in with an upfront agenda, not to learn but to convince. Kudos to Prof Penrose for schooling Dr. Peterson. Okay, I said enough.	2

As for animations with floating hands, most of my characters have floating hands like yours, but mainly use ranged weapons. Limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off, so don't be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it. If you're not too attached to the melee combat, why not focus on ranged instead? Kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side."	2

"Great video. I'm a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position, so I have some ideas on the markets for both jobs.

In my opinion, the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed. Those folks oftentimes won't even get past the HR screener.

There's so many new data science and analytics Master's programs that have opened up, along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable (statistics, computer science, economics, physics, etc) that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview. Even if you have a great portfolio, the HR screen is not even going to look at it.

However, if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics master's degrees the job market becomes super easy."	2

Re Mav's F-18 being unable to fly again after his 'demo', pulling Gs damages the structure of aircraft. Too many Gs will break the airframe immediately, but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage: microscopic cracks that build up over time, invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks, sometimes during normal non-extreme flying. To combat this, all aircraft have a rated 'G-life', that is the maximum cumulative number of Gs they can pull in their lives before they're retired as a precautionary measure. Mav's extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his F-18 immediately, but they may have used up so much of it's G-life that it's effectively scrap anyway."	0

The trouble with the holographic notion is POV (point of view) on the one hand and photon density on the other,  then if we had three or more hands all of the substance that cant be projected and of course light speed. Having said that, I do agree that all of the forces are actually expressions of the same phenomenon, that being the interaction of matter energy with the Higgs Field at the plank scale. To my thinking this interaction elevates the energy level of the field proportional to the interacting mass and this is gravity the energy level of which creates the effect of the curvature of space. So that is another effect that cannot be projected as a hologram.	1

"I honestly think Marques should start a gaming channel, only so we can appreciate him ""enjoying"" his tech in the way most people will do. Being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel, but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticising...which to be fair no one with sense would think he doesn't enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition."	2
#AskGCNTech As a heavier rider, I feel Im always in the max range of gears, either hardest gear on flatsh roads or my easiest gear when I see any sustained gradients. I currently run a compact chain set with a 12-30 cassette on the rear. Would I benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear	0

"*2 more facts about the Platypuses:*
? _They used to be giants:_ The ancient versions of a lot of modern animals, including?penguins, were oversized monsters compared to the animals we know todayand platypuses are no different. In 2013, the discovery of a single tooth helped?researchers identify?a prehistoric platypus that was more than three feet longdouble the size of the modern animal.

? _They lack a stomach:_ Platypuses (platypodes?and?platypi?are technically also correct, but much rarer in use) aren't the only animals to forgo an acid-producing part of the gut; spiny echidnas, and nearly a quarter of living fishes all have a?gullet?that connects directly to their intestines.

"I found a really fancy simple and inexpensive chair design. You put down a slab on the ground, a door on the back, trap doors on the sides and of all things a sign post above the slab on the door. Now this works best with two different wood types but it still looks really cool warped for the sign and slab look best for me.

also does anyone else see spiders in the black and red tericota or nemo fish in the blue orange taracota? might be a story telling ability there. might be fun to explore."	2

"Scenario 1: Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs
Explanation: It is supervised learning. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data, it is supervised learning.


Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someones past music choices
Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).
This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.


Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious-looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions
Explanation: It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, hence there are no labels of ""fraud"" and ""not fraud"". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'."	1

It< makes sense,  BTC and crypto is off helping to regulate, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize.   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 7 btc and 15ETH from day-trade with Leroy Davids Crypto in few weeks	1

If you read Barbara Walter's How Civil Wars Start you would know that there are two issues that lead to violence - anocracy and factionalization. Democracies don't fight, nor do authoritarian states, it's the transition from one system to the other where the hazards are found - that's anoncracy. Factions in the book means when people sort themselves by ethnic or sectarian attributes, rather than policy preferences, and this sorting creeps into their entire lives. We've been on that course since the Tea Party started. The only cure is doubling down on democratic participation.

This tutorial is AMAZING! I was a bit confused at the end when finishing off, but I eventually solved it hours later. I can't believe it only took 2 days for me to solve! That's really amazing for a beginner. I really expected it to take WEEKS, but it was only 2 days!	2

"Glazers will not sell until the value of the brand Manchester United depreciates. From a financial point, Uniteds brand value is far superior compared to others. United can easily fetch 7 billion if put up for a sale. So unless, the brand value is affected, things wont change. 

Glazers have proved that brand value is not affected by on field performances. The occasional noise and drama associated with United will be enough to keep it rolling."	1

Thank goodness. Even though I'm not an iPhone user, seems like when one company does something, others follow and I'm getting tired of them taking features off of phones that are greatly needed to a lot of us. Keep the charging port. We pay too much for phones these days for multiple things to be missing on these devices every few years. Especially when we have to buy everything separately making it even more expensive. It's frustrating.	0

It strikes me that -- as a layman -- typically in physics there's only one or two right answers about how a system can evolve. Seeing as this is something of an epistemological framework (I like epistemology and they're important for getting new perspectives), and there's a functionally infinite expansion of the number of ways a complex system can evolve, I'm struggling to see how we're going to find this needle in a haystack of can's and can't's. That is, without lots and lots of ways to generate new ideas about how the system will evolve and new razors for eliminating impossible actions.	1

"I always find it interesting that the statement ""logistic regression is a classification method"" is repeated so often, despite 'regression' being right there in the name.  Like decision trees (CART), random forest and other similar methods, there are both regression and classification versions of the method.  In a binary outcome problem, we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads (1) and 1-p of coming up tails (0).  We can either predict p, a continuous value between 0 and 1, or we can predict the outcome, itself, which is in {0,1}.  The former is regression; the latter is classification.  Logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff (sometimes, but not always, 0.5) to predict the outcome.  Many times, the probability is more important (for example, lots of the same type of customer -> you do not want to assume all of them are 1's, when p is estimated to be 0.6) and sometimes the outcome is more important (for example, making a decision to approve an application for credit.)"	1

I guess you can't teach self-driving cars using RL in the real world (punishing them if they collide would be a little too late). So I would guess that RL is used only in lab simulations, and then later in the real world, these systems are only performing the task (without actively using RL). Do I get it right?	0

"Jungkook and Jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances, they are both the ones I noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out, and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering. 

Jungkook has gotten injured multiple times, he's almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted MULTIPLE times or came close to it....

I of course worry about all the members but I always worry the most for Jimin & JK because we KNOW how much they would put a performance and entertaining army above their health sometimes :("	0
"Regarding Cans vs. Bottles: At least in Germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly, since they get used again and again. You bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop, they then get sent to a cleaning plant, where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water. Afterwards they get reused for beer. The size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard, so different brewers use the same bottles.

It's far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans."	1

I never saw Gordon Ramsay but I saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast. The potato pancake was my favorite on the menu!

"*Description of exclusive video footage:*

1:10 - Panel starts with a Sizzle reel narrated by Stan Lee. ""Marvel has always been and always will be a reflection of the world right side our window."" Footage from previous films plays: The Avengers, Infinity War, Black Panther... ""Today is our time."" Phase 4 titles start to be included. ""Welcome home,"" declares Vision. All three Spider-Man land together. Disney+ shows cut by with new heroes being included. It culminates with Clea opening a portal, Professor X, Thor landing, Matt Murdock catching a brick, Kingpin, more shots from Phase 4 movies and shows. The Illuminati, the Eternals, and more. Right at the end Miss Minutes jump scares the crowd.


10:40 - *Official Trailer | She-Hulk: Attorney at Law | Disney+ (YouTube)*


13:43 - *Secret Invasion* footage begins with a shot of a field as a beam of light opens along the horizon and a silhouetted figure resembling a classic grey alien emerges. As the figure gets closer, it takes on a less and less abstract shape until we see it is in fact Nick Fury, looking pretty grizzled after his time in space. Maria Hill meets with Fury at a bar. She tells him that shes been unsuccessfully trying to reach him for years. Maria asks why after all this time he decided to come back. This is different, he says. 

In a montage, we get quick glimpses of Talos encountering a group of evil Skulls, Emilia Clarke shooting a gun, Kingsley Ben-Adir multiplying into several identical forms in a confrontation with Fury, and Olivia Colman talking to Nick Fury saying Youre in no shape for this Fury. We also see Rhodey being questioned about his security detail and a shot of Martin Freeman as Agent Everett K. Ross. The trailer ends with Talos asking what the Skulls want from Nick Fury and Fury declaring, Im the last person standing between them and what they really want.


19:18 - *Ant-Man: Quantumania* footage opens at City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, where Scott Lang is reading an excerpt from his new memoir, titled Look Out For The Little Guy, to an enraptured crowd, including a beaming little kid dressed in Ant-Man cosplay. He explains that he is still on call if the Avengers need him, but that his main priority in life is taking care of his daughter, Cassie. As he finishes the chapter and the crowd applauds, Scotts phone rings, and the caller ID tells him that its the SFPD, leading him to remark aloud, Why is jail calling?

After Scott bails his daughter, Cassie Lang, out of jail, they are seen eating dinner with the Pym/van Dynes (Hope, Hank, and Janet). Scott explains that he knows she is just trying to help, and when Cassie says that she is trying to do something that matters, her dad reminds her that he literally saved the world. This comment receives fake shock from everyone else, who sarcastically note that he has never mentioned that fact before, and Janet tells him that he should write a book about it. Shrugging it off, the Avenger retorts, Youre all welcome for all not being dust.

Voice over narration from Kang The Conqueror begins, ""You're an interesting man Scott Lang. You've lost a lot of time. But time isn't what you think. It's not a straight line."" This dialogue is played as the heroes stand in a lab around some kind of device, which unexpectedly turns on. As it powers up, it emits a bright blue light that sends out an energy wave, and Cassie gets sucked inside of it. As Scott Lang panics and tries to grab her, he too is pulled inside the light along with the rest of the main cast, landing them in the Quantum Realm. 

In montage footage, The characters wander through a trippy sci-fi landscape where they run into Bill Murray, who is wearing a kind of fantasy robe. He seems to recognize Janet van Dyne. We also get a glimpse of MODOK. Kangs voiceover continues, explaining that he knows how everything in Scotts life ends. Scott responds, I dont know who you are, but youve made a big mistake. Im an Avenger.  The footage ends with Kang stepping out of the shadows, ""You're an Avenger? Have I killed you before?""


23:31 - *Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3* footage begins with Nebula piloting the ship as it is captured by Ravagers. She tells them to stand down as they have an appointment with Gamora, who is now leader of the Ravagers. Gamora appears, wearing all black and looking super tough. There's a shot of Peter Quill on his ship, looking sad. Peter reflects back on their time together. ""You were everything to me,"" he said. ""I thought you were gone but you're here and I miss you."" Gamora tells him that person was not her. 

In a montage set to ""Do You Realize"" by Flaming Lips, we see the Guardians in colorful spacesuits, leaping into space, the evil monster from the beginning of the last film, Peter and the team getting off in what looks like an Earth neighborhood. Nebula is helping to put up a sign in what appears to be a business district with alien writing. There's a flashback to a baby version of Rocket Raccoon. We get a look at Will Poulter's Adam Warlock, who has gold skin, Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary, and Cosmo the psychic Russian space dog, played by Borats Maria Bakalova. Groot fights back to back with Quill, now fully grown and even more bulky, muscular, and tall than in the original film. There is a shot of the team in their classic blue uniforms with red trimming from the comics. 

The Guardians are bounding across an alien planet. Theyre each wearing brightly colored suits, each one different: blue, green, red, orange and yellow. Peter tries to talk to Gamora about their past. He asks if she might be willing to open herself up and she says I dont think so, Quinn. Peter corrects her Quill. Its Quill. At which point Mantis tells Peter that theyre on an open channel and everyone can hear.  

The footage ends with the Guardians all walking in slow motion, Groot, thicker and more muscular, no Rocket, and Gamora slightly off in the background.


58:21 - *Marvel Studios Black Panther: Wakanda Forever | Official Teaser (YouTube)*

Tesla has finally unveiled their Tesla Pi Phone and it is a beauty! The phone comes with a 6.39-inch AMOLED display, 12GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It runs on Teslas own operating system, Tesla OS. The best part? The price tag! Tesla is selling the Pi Phone for only ?799 in the UK!	2

100% the most stable beta Ive ever done on an apple product. Think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever. My biggest complaint is the UI for a lot of logins in safari. Not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesnt fit right. Im sure there is some kind of setting I can tweak, but LOVE the weather Lock Screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean! The layout of settings is a lot better also, even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything, but it is much more intuitively than previous improvements.	2
I've replay it many times. It's really great!!!	2
Gotta say this is one of the best episodes of the series in a while! I actually think every single one of these things would be something I'd go out to buy, especially the LED sign. I finally am picking back up my plan to build my own PC and the flexibility of the sign adds a lot of, well, flexibility on how I want my endgame to turn out.	2

Your explanation is realistic and straight to the point<. On the other hand there are many ways of manipulating the market, I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but i was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market , all that changed when i encountered (Gerard McDonald) strategy. more emphasis should be put into day trading as it Is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.	1

I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved. I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip. I would get the occasional hiccups but I might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update.	2

As someone who is following channels like BuzzFeed, tasty, food insider and many more channels who review food of India vs other countries, since 2017, I'll have to agree that i GENUINELY enjoyed this video. The editing, the humour, the variety, everything is just so indulging and fun to watch. Rather than your average countless food comparison videos which feel like they're all the same, this was refreshing to watch. Kudos! Looking forward to more of this content!!!	2

I personally enjoy the old school phones.  I have such a hard time hearing my iPhone at max volume without the speaker on.  If I worked in an office I would definitely buy one.  People forget how ergonomic those old phones are.  It's not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head.  I also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones, ear phones, whatever... cause me a bunch of pain.  Looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone.	2

I majored in Biology with minors in chemistry and philosophy. Always loved reading and sometimes I wish I majored in English. I want to start writing soon but I just need to find the time outside of my scientific career lol. Like you, Ive always seen myself as a bibliophile but was frequently discouraged from studying the arts. I kept reading and I now have a small personal library. I love the feeling of just thinking and getting lost in a book; dissecting the words and the scenes they provoke in my mind. You brought up some good points and relatable experiences. Thank you	2
"The first thing I want you to know,whom ever you might be, is that God loves you.  I don't care what you have done in the past.  I don't care of the mistakes you have made.   The blunders we all have.  He loves you, I want you to understand that.  Millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn.  In just a few moments time, if you believe it, is all God requires, believe it.  Forget about your past.  When they put Jesus in that tomb, they put all of your sins in that tomb as well.  When Jesus walked out of that tomb, He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus.
I am going to pray, and I want you to pray with me.  I am going to say the words that you need to say.  Saying words cannot save you, but if you truly believe in your heart, you will be saved. And I want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart.  And Jesus Christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life.  
Let us pray.

Dear God in Heaven.
I come to you.
I am sorry for my sins and the way I have lived.
The things I have done.
Please forgive me.
Cleanse me.
With your precious blood.
From every sin, I have ever committed.
Right now, with my mouth, I confess, the Lord Jesus.
And in my heart, I believe that Jesus died for me and rose from the dead.
And I accept Jesus Christ, this very moment, as my savior, my redeemer, and I make Him the Lord of my life.
And right now, I am a new creation, I am washed, I am cleansed, I AM SAVED.  
We ask this all in the name of Jesus. Amen."	2

"i have the elite series 1 controller still and it was sent into service once for the rubber loosening and a bumper not working correctly. the design and thought behind the elite series controllers is awesome, but it does require more work done to the design. esp after hearing the same rubbergripproblem happens also on series 2.
but i also remember microsoft being at first very oppositional to the idea of the ""free to repair"" thing, but shortly after that they were called in again and microsoft had completely reversed their decision, so if a third party repairservice was able to repair anything to my series 1 controller as its been a while since i bought it, id be all in favor of it!! that would just secure the longevity of any controller basically for the foreseeable future and im glad microsoft and xbox is supporting that !"	1

I found myself motivated, more knowledgeable and confident to approach a job interview with just GCSEs to me name at late 20s in a competitive environment and not only did I secure a financial operations Interview but I have now just secured a promotion upon studying this interview just 10 months later.
I have learnt so much from you, but the most important lesson Ive learnt is to install that self confidence in yourself because no matter what degree you have if you cant sell it, it wont work. 
Much love and keep up the good work and I hope to meet you one day ??"	2

Phone are no longer compared by speed but by their features and use cases. Many mobile apps won't port and develop an app if no one uses them. Look at Instagram, they still don't have an iPad version. If he proposes a plan that entises both potential customers and developers then it should work. I highly doubt he'll venture to the mobile market and build another os from the ground up. Both apple and Android has a massive library.	1

Thank you for such an informative video, appreciate people from real time experienceare sharing it with people which will he a great help to so many.., I'm working as a software engineer but don't think I'm good at technical so was thinking to move to non technical roles.

I am with Bsc maths and Msc computers background,  and in 2016 thought searched so much how to utilise my maths skills in IT, but unfortunately couldn't find so much that time..now when I hear on Data scene I feel I lost so much opportunity,  but I would like to resstart my learning and your videos are really inspiring.

It ended up that a big section of the test was on a topic we didn't go over in class but I had watched Crash Course vids about it. Anyway I just recently found out that I did pass my test!!!!

"Tell Me About Yourself - Job Interview
 -Mr. Davis is ready to interview now.
 - thank you
 -hello Mr Torrus, nice to meet you. 
 i'm tom Davis, the manager of LCI software. 
 -nice to meet you Mr Davis
-first i'd like to congratulate you on passing our aptitude test. 
you did very well. 
-thank you.
-so, how did you hear about this job?
-i saw an advertisement online. 
i clicked on it 
and it brought me to your company's website, 
where i applied for it.
-makes sense.
what do you know about our company so far?
-i've read on your website 
that for over 10 years LCI software has delivered professional services.
on software development projects for clients all over the world.
i can tell from the pictures and client testimonials on the website that you do great, 
quality work. 
-yes, we always try to do quality work. 
the software products we build help many brands transform their businesses.
So, tell me about yourself. 
-i completed a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Biology 
and a Master's Degree in Environmental informatics. 
i managed to get a job in the environmental engineering industry.
but i soon realized i wasn't cut out for that job 
and decided to move to a different industry.
i decided to take the path of a software developer.
-wow, what determined you to make such a bold career shift?
-i've had a great enthusiasm for technology since an early age.
i've always loved computers and gadgets and enjoyed building them and taking them apart.
i took online courses endorsed by high-profile universities and studied how to code. 
i have a few official software certificates.
i started by building websites for people i knew. 
it helped me build a portfolio of projects.
i got my first IOS development job at a software agency called tech services.
i had the opportunity to learn more about the software- building process there.
But, since there were not too many projects at that agency, 
after two years i decided to look for another job.
i soon started to work at an international startup company, Soft Solutions. 
it was a good chance to join a team. 
i've been able to use my training and experience fully at this company.
i gained experience in many things like teamwork, 
time management and quick decision making.
-how long have you been working for Soft Solutions?
-i've been working there for three years.
-why do you want to leave that job?
-i'm looking for a company where i can contribute more and grow. 
i'm ready to take the next step of my career.
-what exactly made you apply for this job at our company?
-i can see that your company has much future growth potential. 
i would love to grow my career at a company 
that has a great reputation in the software industry.
-what are your strengths? 
-my strengths are persistence and courage. 
i give my all to achieve my goals in spite of any hardships 
i might encounter along the way. 
i have a hard working nature. 
i'm always looking for ways to improve and grow. 
i'm also a great team player.
-can you provide an example of how you acted as a team player?
-i always tried to help my teammates complete their tasks if i had completed mine.
whenever someone needed to leave earlier, i would offer to cover for them. 
i'm willing to do whatever it takes for the team or company to succeed.
-great! 
so... what would you do if you didn't get on with someone on your team?
i would try to sort things out in a calm and rational manner. 
i would do my best to get on with that person for the sake of the team.
-what are your weaknesses? 
i can be a bit too straightforward at times and sometimes that hurts people.
but i'm working on this, and try to stop myself from being overly direct.
-where do you see yourself in five years?
-in five years, i'd like to be seen as someone with deep expertise in software development.  
i hope to be offered the opportunity to take the lead on some projects.
-there are definitely promotion opportunities at our company, 
depending on your achievements and expertise.
do you work well under pressure?
-usually i don't panic and manage to maintain self-control. 
there were many tight deadlines and stressful situations at my previous jobs.
i always put in extra hours and did my best in meeting the needs of the clients.
i've always delivered high quality work and respected my deadlines.
-interesting... 
can you tell me about a recent accomplishment or success you had?
i was part of the team that built the Louis kitchen app.
with this app, it's easy to order your favorites, even when you're on the go.
i love creating something that people can interact with and enjoy.
-that's quite impressive, i must admit.
okay, thanks so much for coming in, Mr Torrus. 
it was great to meet you. 
-it was great to meet you too.
-i'll give you a call tomorrow. 
-sounds good. i look forward to it. thank you.

So we found that the problem wasnt the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in. And rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame, it was easier to say kids arent learning because theres something wrong with the books, teachers, and schools. I love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance. Now weve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live (or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live.)	0

Love the breakdown. I started my first business from money I made off dividends. With what Ive learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out. So the onus is on newbies to beware. Having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out.	2

Software is much better too. Not to mention, Apple is bringing back COLORS to their products. No more space gray, gold and silver. We have blue iPhones, red, green purple, sierra blue, midnight green, pink, so many beautiful colors. Red Apple Watch, blue Apple Watch, blue AirPods max, pink and green.

"The guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use. Agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people, their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person. They know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits. And most importantly, none of this can be used too convict you. They can't just say ""yep he's the murderer, he is lying"" and throw you in prison. It is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too, or who they should focus on. They still need to investigate and find actual  PROOFV to convict you. If you didn't do it, they can't convict you just because you seemed like you were lying."	0

"I did my undergrad in Computer Science and I'm finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering. It always drives me nuts when people ask what I do and then assume either is just ""programming"" or ""software engineering"". I try to explain it like this: Computer Science is centered around mathematics(computational science) and problem solving; developing algorithms and optimization. Programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems. Computer Engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems. I always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took Computer/Electrical Engineering as undergrads. Because they, generally speaking, are simply trying to make X thing work, and I am trying to make X thing run as efficient as possible. You can take several different paths to become a coder, but there's very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines. Anyone looking at going to school for Computer Science should understand this. You are learning to be a problem solver first, coding is secondary. Anyone can learn to code. But, being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career. If you go down this path, you are going to be doing far more math than coding, and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code. You will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts, libraries, and frameworks. But, those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use. I hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into."	0

"**Summary**:
- machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data
- there are lots of different ways (""algorithms"") that machines can learn 
- the algorithms can be grouped into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms*

- the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be input-output pairs or just inputs
- supervised learning algorithms require input-output pairs (i.e. they require the output)
- unsupervised learning requires only the input data (not the outputs)

- here is how, in general, supervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input, then the associated output
- you repeat the above step many many times
- eventually, the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and it will predict the output for you

- here is how, in general, unsupervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input (without the associated output)
- you repeat the above step many times
- eventually, the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with

* the first example in this video used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm

Hope that was useful to someone!

Thanks for the video, really enjoyed it!! :)"	1

"Alex Jones defense might actually be brilliant. ""I didn't do it on purpose""

Look at the lawyer he hired, sent the prosecution all the evidence they needed. ""I didn't do it on purpose""

He lied under oath ""I didn't do it on purpose"".

I mean he's clearly guilty of torturing the victims of an elementary school shooting, his choosen defense is the only option that had at least a 1% chance of working.  (But ultimately him hiding his own money so he can declare bankruptcy defense is much stronger, the old white man defense)"	0

"Hey Erling. Paralegal here. I saw the end of your video, but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit. Lawsuits are not fun in any way (unless your the attorney/firm) and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress. My parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always.

Moreover, if the other side has an attorney, they have the advantage of knowing how the system works, such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase (Rule 26a dislcosures, interrogatories, evidence you intend to use at trial, depositions of plaintiffs, defendants, and expert witnesses, etc.) and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge. 

I truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself. Just be careful with how you proceed. Pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done. Also remember it's a legal system and not a justice system. 

This is not legal advice, just a concerned fan. Lawyers or other legal professionals, please correct anything I may have overlooked/unintentionally misconstrued. 

P.S. I think the service (the guy who threw the papers at you rudely) was fine, unfortunately. You identified yourself. Once that happens, they can just leave it at your doorstep."	0

"To everyone who's studying with this music:

Checklist: 

? A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate??

? Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time??

? Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone??

? a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.?

? Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.?

?Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy ??


Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 
You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. (?`???)

I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight ????

And remember if you're going through anything hard, I'm here to listen and talk to you, ik I'm just a stranger but I'm human too <3 you can reply or we can chat on discord if you're not confident talking here. ?

As fun as these videos are, I do want to give a certain amount of warning to HS students. Just because you have the grades, scores, letters of rec, essays, and extracurriculars doesnt mean youll be accepted into these schools.

I even did robotics research in HS at a university, applied to the university, and then was denied from that university. So much of it is just an arbitrary lottery, its hard to truly know.	0

What would it look like if we met the extent of the knowledge God allowed us to know? It would be like we were contained inside of a realm, like a bubble and so one part of the bubble is connected to the next part of the bubble and it is all connected but we can never know what is outside of the bubble to know how the bubble truly works because we can never be outside the bubble. When pressed against the bubble we can see a bit ways outside of it to see that we are inside a bubble, like finding balance between the left and right side of a bicycle. God set limits of the ocean and of the mountains and of the thickness of our skin and since He will always know more than us He has set limits on what we are allowed to know. But it is a good thing to flesh out all the areas we are allowed to know to make use of them.	1

My grandfather actually played with Bobby regularly in 1956 at the West Orange Chess Club in New Jersey. They played on the same team in inter-state tournaments. I found some of my Grandpas old letters and its pretty cool. He won multiple chess championships (some amateur and some professional) in the late 40s and early 50s. He also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines. He was born in 1909 and while I like to think he taught Bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year, its likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa. My grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially (chess tournaments didnt pay well back then). Though, he probably played teenage Bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future. If a 13 year old made a multi-time champion quit the game entirely, he must have been truly special. My grandpa could card count so I dont think he had a problem switching to bridge, and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career. I never got to meet him because he died before I was born (Im only 23), I wouldve loved to ask him about Bobby. Maybe my mom knows a bit more. All I have are letters and a few chess trophies. Its very hard to collect information from the early 50s.	2

When I started in Computer Science I was surprised how many of my classmates didn't even like to code.  They saw programming as at best a steeping stone to their real career.  My CS coursework certainly never taught me much programming.  My best teacher was my library of Plum Hall books.  In my case a professor liked my code and recommended me as a research assistant which was my first computer job.  The position was supposed to go to a CS grad student and I was an undergrad music major.  My research areas were mainly data compression and pattern recognition.  I was within a stone's throw of finishing my music degree when I realized that I met the requirements for a CS degree so I ended up graduating with a CS major, music minor even though I had 3 times as many hours in music as CS.  In my case I didn't program for long. Even though I enjoyed coding my bigger interest was systems and that is the direction I went after graduating.	1
I'm so happy that you started giving courses on machine learning. I appreciate your clear teaching style.	2

Also it may be wise to learn MATLAB to a fairly advanced level before doing ML. The jump from basic Python to ML is quite a big one,  I was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it. You must know how to populate matrices by row and column, take the average, etc. A basic Python course won't cover these things, but MATLAB courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist.	0

"A minor correction, bitcoin is *not* anonymous; it is pseudonymous. All transactions that have ever occurred since Bitcoin's inception is permanently recorded on the public world-wide ledger. There're no names and identities associated with each transaction but it doesn't mean someone can't figure out who made those transactions with some research. In fact, there are already tools to help assist with this.

Given that fact, using bitcoins for illicit transactions is ill advised; fiat cash like dollars and euros is better suited for that purpose."	1

Though reminding ourselves of the horrific times in the past might console us to get through this pandemic, you can't deny that the definition of 'catastrophic' is different for everyone.

A slightly lighthearted story, but one time me and my roommate were driving in an unfamiliar area (somewhere outside Sydney, Australia) and google maps told us to take a small backroad. It looked fine and it was paved and everything, and it was significantly shorter than the alternative route. Only our plans were thwarted, because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor, and it was moving really really slowly in front of us. We couldnt turn around either because the road was too narrow and there was a metal fence on one side and a steep hill on the other. We literally just had to slowly drive behind this tractor for almost the entire length of the road, and it took about an hour.	1

"I think cephalopod intelligence is hard wired. An octopus has a very short lifespan, as little as 18 months, and has to learn everything from the moment it hatches completely on its own.

Its mother died before it emerged from the egg, so it is born an orphan. This has huge implications, because despite being intelligent it has no mentor to learn from.

Its also a mollusk, so in a way its a slug with awesome superpowers.

Theyre fascinating animals."	1
"Okay, this gonna be a long one, sorry about that.

I'm French, and there's an interesting fact about France, it's that we are brutally honest. Most other people don't like that, so we are called arrogant, rude, obnoxious, but we are not, we are just honest, and people don't like honesty. When we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other, it's not because we cheat more than you, it's just because we honestly answered the questions. You're probably wondering where I'm going with that.

Well, I was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other, not staying friends with each other, yada-yada-yada, and I can't relate. At all. Because it doesn't work like that here. I still know a lot of female who were already friend in High School (and I'm 40), whenever I see my mother, or my Girlfriend, or my Girl Friends, they are just friendly.

I dunno, it's probably only on screen, but the number of time I saw in TV shows or movies a group of girls being friendly, then as soon as one leave, they all turn to bitch on this one; that's something I never saw in France. They bitch on her while she is here, and she doesn't take it badly, because she does the same.

So I was wondering, why is that ? Why are they still friends if it's different for others, then I realized, because we are honest.

My female friends won't hesitate to look at each others and say ""Wow girl, you look like shit today"" ""Didn't you put on weight recently? Maybe you should work out"" and for me, that's a healthy relationship.

Why does American males manage to stay friends ? Because they trash talk each other, because they are honest, because they say things as they are. Yeah, sometimes we have fallouts, but we mend things,.

Why can't female American stay friends ? Because they are sneaky, they lie, ""Ooooh, you look gorgeous girl"", ""You are so strong, I envy you"", while not thinking any of that. Sooner or later, in any relationship based on lie, the truth will come out, and it's not going to be pretty."	0

This video is really good and legit. I do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age. There are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free. The learning process to build an entire game is long, and difficult. Especially if you're thinking of an rpg. In my experience, single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience, multiplayer games are a stretch to even try(alone or with a small team). But don't let the reality beat you up. If you really really want something, you can make it happen. I've been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years, and have prototyped/concepted my own rpg 5 times. Only now in 2022, am i confident enough to build the official version. But I've done it. I've learned enough to make it happen, and you can too. (Knowing is one thing, then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life). CREATION IS KING! NEVER GIVE UP!	2

As a comp sci student, I find it interesting how you explained this, but rather than teaching I would more describe it as evolution.

I think explaining this way (at least for me) is easier, because bots dont learn they evolve through the generations.	1

"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app"	0

"Hello, how are you? 
From my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic. 
However, if you want to reach an even wider audience, considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak English, I suggest:
1. To associate the subtitles, even if in English, as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery;
2. That the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way, as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language.
Thanks for the attention, thanks for the video and I wish all success to the Simplilearn team!"	2

Hey Krish, first of all thanks a lot for inspiring me to pursue data science. Wanted to check if it is possible to create a run chart for checking data stability or is there any statistical test to perform the same.	2

I read an article about how there was an issue with police departments getting so attached to their bomb disposal robots that they didn't want to send them into danger.

I had the same exact problem when I started learning: too much jargon and not enough explaining. The tutorial series by a channel called giant_neural_network was great because he teaches you not only the theory but also how to actually code a simple neural network. He does it very visually and it is very well done.	2

I'm so intensely interested in this individual and his affinity to human behavior.	2
I love the videos, Harry. Just a small correction, those insights role is usually that of  a Data Analyst or an Insight Solution Analyst. A Data Scientist's role is usually dependent on Statistics and applying the right ML models.	2

"Tip: Always start with reviews, you can mix up their themes, maybe one review didnt do this but the other did.See whats been strongly estbalished thru time, and check if theyve mentioned controversial parts or gaps of your topic. From this, check recent (past five year-journals about these gaps and where do they stand. 

Also, literature review is quite overwhelming at first given the large amount of information youre gonna see especially for the younger generation given their access to sci-hub, which can put you in a psychological rut. Not just to comfort you, but also as a professional tip YOU DONT NEED TO WRITE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, OR EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TOPIC. Coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important, moreover sufficient. If you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 3-5 studies, try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph. You dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail, unless you see a clash between two papers, then maybe you can re-evaluate their differences in method."	1
"Love your content jedcal, keep it up. I appreciate your honesty in showing the grades you received, including explaining the courses that stood out to you during your attendance at BU.

"I'm only 12 minutes into this video right now, but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the time and spacing you give to explaining a concept. You add pauses, you repeat things with slightly different wording, and you give examples and zoom in and out, linking to relevant thought processes that might help trigger an ""a-ha"" moment in the viewer. Many of these ""hooks"" actually make me understand concepts I've had trouble grasping in Maths, all because of your videos and the way you choose to explain things. So thanks! You're helping me a lot to become a smarter person. :)"	2

"Going through the video after watching the live session that Lakshya did before this video made me realise his unshined  talent that had yet to come to light in ACTING the difference is his pitch, language, body language, taking  thing like ""I will file a case"" for granted really shows his supremacy and how much of an alpha he is it really reminds me of the 'Aparichit'  the person who was in his YouTube video and the person who was in his in his live almost feel like they were two different individuals . I don't support anyone of them prince and his wife had milked there child and they not tackled any of the allegation he was just taking out his anger making personal comments but I can't just blind eye on things that Lakshya said just because I'm his subscriber and this had cleared that the past allegation like ganging up, bulling, were some how true . Lakshya portraying an image of the person that he is not thinking we should not abuse in YouTube because it's an public platform and spread hate but can make an abusive live video on Insta I guess Insta is not a public platform anymore and it's strike one thing that  lakshay is not abuse because of the problem that he had faced in his past for making that kind of content"	1

Great insight! I got into data science right after college and really struggled to do so. The fact that the data science job role is defined so differently at different companies made interviews really hard to prep for. It felt like you need to be a jack of all trades and be well versed in data science, data engineering and data analyst principles and it was just a lot to prep for. Plus a lot of roles require graduate degrees. After I got a role, I left after a year and transitioned into SWE as like you said the expectations didnt match the reality plus I was also at a toxic workplace. I realized that I want to be in a role that is more well-defined and somewhat uniform across companies so if i need to look for a job later, Im not being restricted to only a subset of opportunities bc of the different definitions and requirements.	1

Dieses Mal hat wohl der Feiertag am Montag ein Event am Dienstag verhindert. 
Mal schauen, ob eine neue AppleWatch vorgestellt wird, die meine Series 1 ersetzen k?nnte. 
Das iPhone interessiert mich in diesem Jahr berhaupt nicht. Wenn, dann wrde ich nur ein iPhone 14 mini in Erw?gung ziehen. Ob es eines geben wird  man wei? es nicht! Lassen wir uns durch die eklige Gerchtekche nicht in die Irre fhren.
Denn was ich berhaupt nicht ab kann ist, wenn sich selbst ernannte ?Experten darber aufregen, dass sich Apple-Ger?te versp?ten, die berhaupt nicht nicht angekndigt wurden! ??

When I took my exams so I can get in a university I really wanted to study architecture or art. However things didn't go well and my score was extremely low so I was left with a few options. One of them was computer science and telecommunications. And tbh despite the fact that I had zero interest in programming before, I freaking love this major so much. Sure it's hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works.	2

It looks neat! The screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original Switch and the Switch Lite. I love playing the Switch on table top mode with the Switch Pro controller! It feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel!	2

Hey Ryan or Clement or both lol! quick question.  If you had to place these in certain categories for their specific uses/what each one excels at, what categories would you put each of these machine learning frameworks/tool kits (Tensor Flow, PyTorch, mxnet, and Hugging Face) in?	1
Thats a great concise video summing up the role of a professional data scientist, this video came at the right moment as I transition from academia to industry and totally relate with many of the points mentioned in the video. As mentioned in the later part of the video, I also find the undesirable aspect of data science to be a double-edged sword as on one end the ambiguity may make things unclear but at the same time also leaves room for experimentation and innovation. Papaya Tracker sounds like an interesting personal project!	2
He had his own exercise routine and tool for achieving pitching success.  If I were the coach, I would not obstruct that...as long as no one was hurt in the process.  Those that were angry at him because he didn't the line...their line...then it's an issue of CONTROL over him.  So he's eccentric...let him be eccentric...as long as no one gets hurt including himself.  Just let him lose and let the team win.	1

It seems way more likely to me that the invite is actually referring to astrophotography. The iPhone has improved a LOT in the last few years at low-light photography, especially if you're using a tripod. Plus, if there's going to be a 48mp camera sensor, that'll be amazingly helpful for nighttime shots. I'm about as confident about that as Sam is about it being satellite connectivity ??	2

I still love my Switch, but after owning the Steam Deck for a couple of weeks I have to say - Valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the Steam Deck then Nintendo is the Switch. I've already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then Nintendo has in 5 years. Nintendo needs to take a page out of Valve's playbook here.	2

"18 months ago I started a SOC (Security Operations Center) internship which turned into a full-time job even before getting my CS degree in August 2021. In a week I start as an Information Security Engineer making $90k/yr in the Mountain West region. They needed somebody who had a computer science background and experience in cybersecurity. 

So many good career paths from a bachelor's in CS. But the key in my experience to making the most of your degree is developing your soft skills and being hungry to learn more."	2

Hey KRK , you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest. Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work . So guys don't take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ????	1

"Some notes if anyone needs em!

-Barter system is the alternative to money, but is highly inefficient 
-Money serves as a medium to exchange, store of value, and a unit of account 
-In the past we had the gold standard which connected each dollar to a value of gold
-Stock market is part of the Financial system which is composed of Lenders (corporations and households) and borrowers (households, businesses, governments)
-Financial system = a network of institutions, markets, and contracts that brings lenders and borrowers together 
-3 ways this happens: banks, bonds, stock market
-Banks deal with debt, stocks deal with equity (the difference between the value of assets/ interests and the cost of the liabilities of something owned)
-Financial instrument = a tradeable asset of any kind
-Banks are Financial Institutions = an establishment that conducts financial transactions such as investments, loans, and deposits"	1

I'm beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity. There's place of brashness, boldness, creativity, fear, light touch, nimbleness, anger, bluffs. It is a beautiful game, rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics. It has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one, how many more things are possible in a game, how far ahead can pieces support each other, how deep and far-seeing ideas can be, and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions.	2

<I love the grounded reality of this channel,<I started in crypto in August 2017 ,and I bought in.I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market. I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do. I wish I had bought more. I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Dickson Jenkins.have learned from you and other Youtubrs especially my mentor Dickson Jenkins. who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 2btc to 13btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past. It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research.....	2

For those confused about the Pythagorean theorem, its the method used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a *right* triangle from the two side lengths. The formula is a^2 + b^2 = c^2

That means one side squared plus the other side squared equals the hypotenuse squared (hypotenuse is the longest side, the angled side) so you simply get the square root of the c, and you have the measure of the longest side"	1

Before I get into my comment I would like to say thank you, I really appreciate that fact that you take the time out of your own day making these incredible useful TikTok s and YouTube videos so people can study even though your not making anything off of it. Back to the point, id like to say thank you because right now Im a freshman and I didnt really have a motivation to study for the act but when I was scrolling through tik tok I saw a video with a really hard math problem but you made it seem really easy like I could do it in a minute so after that I did more research and found out how important the act really is so Ive been studying with your YouTube and tiktok videos along with other things on the side, i still have 2 years before I have to take it but your videos are so entertaining they make me want to learn and get better at math.	2

"The reason the eu is so low has to do with the fact that countries in the eu .

unfortunately, these countries are still not doing anything in their country to ensure that their internal economies run better."	0

"What is the best quality of humans?: The ability to love

What is the best quality of AI?: The ability to think logically

These two things are sometimes at odds with each other which the AI most likely figured out which is why it immediately tried to justify it by mixing them both together. One cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time. We sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldn't. As such, an A.I who doesn't understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical (even if it leads to suffering) in order to achieve an objective.

In other words, we have a psychopathic A.I"	0

Its smart to keep the always on display on the 14 series and newer because battery life would likely take a big hit on a phone that only drops to 10Hz (13 Series). 1 Hz is probably best case to keep battery life up to the standard.

"Is There Anybody Out There?	lyrics
____________________________===========
 	I climb the rooftops every morning
And search for life there down below
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I send a signal for survivors
Requesting help on where to go
But there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

'Cause every time that I return to this place I once called home
Yes, every time the walls cry out, you're the last one - you're alone

Oh C is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh C is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

I wander streets that once were crowded
I'm searching houses that were homes
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I'm fighting off the dread that haunts me
But in my empty heart it grows
'Cause there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

And every time I raise my head, panic stares me in my face
Yes, every time I try to think, I get trapped inside a maze

Oh C is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh C is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free

Oh C is there anybody out there?
There must be someone else like me
Oh C is there anybody out there in the cold?
Come raise your voice and set me free"	0

"I appreciate the iPhone, but I honestly stay on Android for so long because it's definitely more affordable. Phones can be cheaper, repairs are cheap as well, spare parts aren't that expensive. I think taking into account also Play store vs App store, since App store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing.
ALSO. Very important is compatibility - people with an Apple setup can be more comfortable with an iPhone, but PC users.. can't really use all the perks of iPhones unless they get such a setup. Which is.. much more costly.

This episode was such a pay off for those of us who have been on this journey of discovery with space time from the beginning.

Three countries I deeply respect, at the frontline of stoneage, barbarian Russian imperialism."	1

"The light sensitivity and erratic behavior are symptoms of a person ""on the spectrum"". It is not uncommon for people like this to prefer lamps to ceiling lights as the glare is annoying to them. Lashing out comes from difficulty communicating, feeling different and knowing you are different, it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight. Fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess. While playing he probably felt safe, knowing the rules, knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didn't understand or care about."	0

Look at what mrbeast goes through for us what a legend	2
I bought a Series S when it first came out and a 3 year gamepass subscription. Was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games.  So I decided to sell the S and buy the Series X. Had the X now for a year  but the other day I suddenly realised that I hadn't turned on my series X for a week. And before that it was just sporadically. So decided to sell.  BUT,  I didn't want to completely move away from gaming and I managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a Series S.  140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition.  Going to sell that,  which will make my Series S end price probably around 60 euros. Can't get better than that!  For casual gamers,. like myself,  the Series S is a fantastic console.	2

I < must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space. First of all, you're just awesome! I've been following for months now and the cinematic videos, excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding. Before anything else, I would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go, but we can try to make predictions using past events, I think prices should run up a lot now, punishing panic sellers and forced sellers. Most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish. Many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses, slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as. Everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective. Everything has changedwe are in a recession, facing stagflation, rising rates, and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof, breaking consumers backs. <There are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market, smart investors trade and take short-term profits. I've made over 11 BTC with 2.1 BTC retail trading, not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market, Kyle Miller, I came across his channel where he shares his charts. <The selling fatigue will wane, and the market will reset. Historically, fortune favored the ones who bought in thought moments, in moments of uncertainty, when prices traded close to the 200wMA.<You can reach MR. Kyle on ?eI???m KyleMiller3  Cheers thank me later.	2

In my dissertation work, I used the non-fluorescent halves of different fluorescent proteins and engineered expression vectors for genes that encoded these appended to target proteins (wt and oncogenic mutant c-Fes kinases) such that the targets would be competent/functional with the attached FP halves, but then when they bind/dimerize/oligomerize to perform phosphorylation-dependent enzymatic activity, then the FP halves would bind as well to become a whole fluorescent protein tagging the target protein dimers! This approach allowed us to observe the action of our targets, localization, quantify dimerization (as a proxy for kinase function in this case as well), etc. Molecular biology is built upon so many tools/techniques that are in and of themselves amazing!	1

"How To Solve the Rubik's Cube FASTER ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmeleO65BHc

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE COMMENTING.

I try to reply often, but ""I don't get step X"" or ""it doesn't work"" is too unspecific and I can't help unless I know exactly what problem you have.


*MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE 4 MOVES*
1:52 has the 4 moves, and you have to be able to do this to understand what ""4 moves"" means when I use it again later on.

*COMMON FIRST LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 1 & 2. If the side colors of the cross or first layer don't line up the way I showed it in the video, then you need to redo it. Pay attention to ALL of the colors on one piece, and don't just pick white pieces randomly. I talk about this in the video, how I'm trying to match the other colors of the white piece (like white/orange etc.)

*TAKING PIECES OUT OF THE SECOND LAYER*
Step 3. At 5:33 I say ""you should already know how to do this"". I admit this is unclear. You should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer. If this does not make sense, watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment.

*COMMON TOP LAYER PROBLEMS*
Step 4. If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 5. There should be no problems here.
Step 6. If you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.
Step 7. Finish the 4 moves (don't stop at 3) every time. Turn the bottom (don't rotate the whole cube) to get the next piece. If it STILL does not work, you need to reassemble the cube as solved.

""Why do I need to reassemble the cube?""
Randomly assembling the cube only has a 1/12 chance of being solvable. If you've ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces, then that can be the problem. If stickers have been switched, you will have to switch them back.

"In Germany, right next to where I live (around 500m from my House) there is a small farm with a rather large Chapel next to it. 

The story behind that Chapel is, that the old Farmer who used to live there built it in order to keep a promise he made to God. He was in the battle of Stalingrad, survived, got captured and shipped to Siberia. While there he promised God, that if he made it out alive, he would erect a Chapel in His honor. 

He died around 15 years ago, very kind man and a good friend of my family. But you could tell that these experiences left their mark on him, as one of his main topics of conversation was always about food (where to get the best bread, who in our village made the best cake etc.)."	1

Very well done. I liked your analogy with football (soccer) and the microscope to start. As you went on I got more interested and I had to buy the book to learn more.

High fashion is sometimes very abstract, very elitist, very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous. But if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too, you find artisans, people who study and excel in a craft. They deserve to be highlighted more. Behind that overpriced Chanel bag is a leather/chain/fabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion. Fast fashion is slowly killing our planet (water consumption, landfills, toxic chemical dumped in village waters, people paid pennies etc), haute couture is rare, its scarce. I find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but I love my high end pieces, that have lasted me years and will continue to do so. Behind these fashion shows are artisans, that will always be better than any fast producing machine.	0
At least in my town, we have 1 old zoning law that prevents THOUSANDS of affordable lots from being developed. Lift that restriction and ideally streamline permitting and loosen regulations. But they won't. Too much local vested interest in keeping the supply down. I know my town isn't the only one with this zoning law.	0

Crypto is off helping to regulate<, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize. And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 16` btc from day-trade with Axel William Crypto in few weeks.	1

"I'm pretty sure this wasn't actually the case, but it almost ""looked like"" Magnus made a ""bet"" (maybe with himself) that he could make X number of moves with his queen and y number of moves with his king and still win or, maybe, just still reach move 30.  That would explain both his laughter and generally humorous demeanor and amateur-like play.  This might be considered some innocent type of trolling or even an inside joke, but I suspect that if something akin or analogous to this had occurred in the NBA or NFL or MLB, some persons would be calling for an investigation.  Just looking for a hypothesis that would account for what occurred in game one of the Carlsen -Firouzja match.  (Note how strangely Carlsen played in game four, was it?, of his match with Pragg.)  I don't know how much Las Vegas type betting goes on with respect to the world of chess, but a game like this could make someone who put money on the game very unhappy.  In some ways, it was embarrassing to watch.  I don't believe that type of behavior advanced the cause of pro chess."	1

I have used Galaxy Tab S7 during my Ph.D. It's been a lifesaver for me. First of all, it is really good for reading journals, note taking and scribbling on the pdf's, secondly, it doesn't strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance, thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with Tab s7 and lastly if you are from a STEM background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams, you can draw those easily with the stylus on Tab s7. I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use, user interface, and cost (you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount).	2

"I've been listening to this guy's speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything I have seen in a long time. I was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school (this wonderful psychologist actually told me in 5th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so I know). So I spent 5 years believing I had adhd when all I had was this thing called childhood. Eventually in 10th grade I switched to an alternative school and everything Robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on. I'm a senior at my alternative school, going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me. I'll spare the details, but I just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what I'm most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and I will do everything in my power to achieve this. I wouldn't have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience, which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity. 

Much thanks to Ken Robinson for his words of wisdom and innspiration andsharing his vision with us.

"We are already in the big crash, Inflation is a
catastrophe. This CPI report is a colossal failure. To bring the housing market to a halt, the FED will have to pull all the stops. The unfortunate issue is that other markets are being decimated.If you want to stay green, you have to rely on a lot of diversification. Currently up 14% and being careful. Still a better deal than leaving it in a savings or checking account yielding 0-1 percent interest."	0

"There's a lot more unusual stuff ""under the hood"" of these guys (and their Echidna cousins). Their skeletons for example, have 'epipubic bones' aka ""pouch bones"" which are only found in Marsupials and Monotremes. But more unusual still, they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle, while ALL other mammals have only two. On a human for example, the pectoral girdle (aka, the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder) is made of two bones: the scapula (shoulder blade) and Clavicle (collar bone), with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum. It means that we, like 'all' mammals, can pivot our shoulders around, not just the arms within the socket. Compare this to birds/reptiles and older Tetrapod groups and you'll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle, with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum. This third bone is the 'Coracoid' bone, and mammals lost it a long time ago... except in Monotremes. On the plus though, like the rigid flight frame of a bird, it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why Platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim (or echidna to dig). Splayed legs, more ribs than other mammals, low body heat,  eggs, venom, etc. honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointy-nosed hedgehog."	1

Great content, I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na?ve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 10.2 BTC when I started at 3.5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from  Alex Gomez.

"I LOVE THIS INTERVIEW!!

I've been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last 2 years. We moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within 4 miles. I keep telling people I know I dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said I should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church. I was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time I'm scared to start even though I have a lot of support at church and friends. 

One of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people. But again, my family is relying on my income to live. I know it would be great! I just need to find a person I trust to help run it along side with me so I can maintain my insurance career at the same time since it's not demanding at all."	2

"Masters Union cannot replace institutions like IIM or IIT because of the sheer fact that MU does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university. Indian colleges or Universities don't have any place in the top institutes of the world (and rightly so) but something that an IIT or IIM has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy.
Because of the implementation of reservation, there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into IIMs and IITs be lacking in certain core subjects (Dont assume I am a casteist because I am outlining a drawback in reservation policy. I completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation) and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but, the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who haven't had access to great education in their schools/colleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education. But in an institution like Masters Union (going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship) the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds, who have had access to great education since kindergarten. While Masters union assures great education, institutions like IITs and IIMs, ensure social equity and great education
(The entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in MU)"	0

My grade 8 science project, back in the late 80's, was on learning styles. My teacher was shocked and surprised when I submitted my project idea. All my subjects were my classmates. Over a span of a couple weeks I tested their comprehension of certain short stories, pictures, and videos; through visual, audio, and reading. When the science fair day came, my booth wasn't the most popular with any of the other kids, but with all the school teachers and parents... they loved it. I remember the results of my project was inconclusive because I tested each student individually with each individual method of learning. No one method of learning is better than another, but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen. But I ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due.	2

Question, is there a specific reason why you recommend taking the SAT twice?

So if I were to get a 1500 the first time, should I really take it again?	1

Amazing video thank you! Yes, atomic motion is perpetual. Mass changing its position in space = motion. Perpetual? Well for most of us billions of years is long enough. So, examples of perpetual motions (does not factor in wear and tear of the device); solar panels, water mills, wind mills, geo thermal (Iceland), John Bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts (I personally recharged hundreds of batteries, with carefully measured results)... The physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view, one device and what it does by itself. Yes that's being confined to thermodynamics. However, look outside the box for energy source (solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels, but from the sun). Thermodynamics is true in CLOSED or ISOLATED systems. Nitinol is also overunity (which perpetual motion is a part of) using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically.  The most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma (an electrically charged - ionized gas). Well, a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas, and they will be energized until the end of time by stars. Are we introverted into a small device set in motion, or are we scientifically, logically looking at the big picture? As long as we stay stuck in a boxed-in frame of reference, we don't progress. Every advances made was possible by women and men who dared looking at things holistically, from all points of view. Cheers!	2

What I love about computer programming in particular, is that unlike any other subject taught in schools, this one forces students to use the creative and logical parts of their brains for once. What every country needs for success is smart people that can come up with solutions, so I believe computer programming is something that should be taught from early on in order to train young minds. Of course it's not for everyone, I know people who won't understand it no matter how they explain it to them, but then again mindless memorizing is not for everyone either.	2

I just transitioned to Apple late last year for being an android fan for almost 10 years. I used to mock their features. And as I grow older and matured, I realized that solutions of Apple tends to be more on sustainable and long-term. Their products tend to be like the durables/home appliances that is made to last and not be replaced. I just want to highlight the part on your video where Samsung is mocking Apple for same design practice, and I think, they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it. No wonder, there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphone/PC world. :)	2

I was constantly exhausted no matter how much I ate or slept. It was affecting my job, my workouts at the gym, even my free time. I felt terrible, like I was sick or something. I finally went to the doctor and found out I had an iron deficiency, so my doctor put me on supplements and offered me an infusion and I feel so much better! So it's definitely worth getting bloodwork done and going to the doctor's on top of all these great tips :)	2

"Points that were missed: 

- Apple arguably has a specific Monopoly in the US with smartphones because of iMessage not being open with other multi-platform messaging apps. This weirdly only applies in the States. The rest of the world favours things like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger ( both owned by meta, Which is its own issue). That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. 

- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. 

- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there. Google play is still the most preferred store on Android phones, so Google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software."	1

So impressed Marko has made a video regarding energy use in the EU. It is useful to view the data from just a futures point of view, which is how companies plan on future availability.  Way to keep up the good work Marko! BTW - nuclear energy has been overlooked for the last 30 years and needs to come back. It is sad how German and French embraced nuclear energy then pulled back which leaves them open to the crisis now. America should take heed.	1

I think it doesn't matter whether our AI-s are sentient. We should treat them as they were. Treating them as such when they aren't may slow down the development, so what? I think it's far worse to treat them as they aren't when they are. Ultimately you can't tell the difference. You can't tell (or prove rather) if your own mother is sentient, as in in conscious, and yet you treat her as if she was.	0

"After the foul taste the original GoT left in my mouth, I didn't have very high hopes for this. Yet I watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons, maybe not quite there yet, but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it.

I find it hard to pinpoint Daemon, on the one hand he wants to show strength (the city watch part), but then he's also arrogant (the tournament, claiming victory while the fight wasn't over) and straight up horrible (heir for a day?). But on the other hand, he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her, her father would need him more now than ever before, which shows he also cares for Viserys. I think him calling Viserys weak, was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king, which is in line with what he did with the city watch, he feels like the king should show his strength.

Viserys seems like he's held things together for those 9 years, but this clearly is coming to an end, I feel like he's made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon, this won't make things easy for Rhaenyra, who already has to fight the fact that some people don't want a woman on the throne. In the end I think it will be between those two and Viserys will be long gone from the picture."	0

"The big concern for sure is how effective the algorithm is in determining the 'helpful content'. 

There will be no doubt many sites caught in the crossfire. It's important to remember too that this is aimed across all of Google - not just for product review sites or niche sites. I feel that sites that focus on one topic/area of expertise should do well so long as the content is on point - but the guidelines although detailed in places, are still pretty vague. 

The data collection exercise should shine some light hopefully."	1

Great advice, all of it! I'm one of those you mentioned near then end, with a medical condition. Sleep isn't rejuvenating for some, no matter how much we get. Working towards good sleep habits is still helpful, as it regulates our lives and helps us pace what minimal energy we have, so if you're reading this comment, no matter if you're chronically ill like I am, or just a tired person without a debilitating illness, practice good sleep habits. Be patient - it'll help.	2

For the platform game, I think the second go was almost perfect. If he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question, then it wouldve been foolproof. Like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person, then asked everyone which hand held the coin. Thats not a perfect solution, but thats the kind of question Im thinking of.

When you read a novel, how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author? For instance, one of my favorite books is The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov. If you read it by itself, it is such an interesting novel, however, learning the history of its writing in the background of Stalin's Russia makes it even more interesting. How much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners, if at all?	2

<Crypto is off helping to regulate<, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize. And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 16` btc from day-trade with Axel William Crypto in few weeks.	1

I was born into a relatively poor family.  Never had the opportunity to go to college.  I became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school.  I happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the US.  I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught.  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA.  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40.  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you.  I finally found a banker that would talk to me.  I explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money I would borrow he was floored.	2

A few weeks ago I driving my car and decided to listen to a classical cd I had in my car in the player. It was Beethoven's 9th. I listened for a few minutes and decided to go to the radio instead. So I pressed the radio button but it didn't seem to work because it was still Beethoven's 9th. After several minutes of punching that button, I discovered that it had worked perfectly! The radio and the cd were both playing Beethovens' 9th! But the part that stunned me most was that they were at the very same place in the piece! I could shift back and forth and not miss a thing! Freaky!	2

It was around the summer of 1974 when a friend and I went to the Fresno Zoo. As we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water. We watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water. Needless to say, we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother. We could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight. Later that night  the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the Zoo that day. That baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals I've ever seen!	2

in short and in my humble opinion; The price effect will be a drop in the ocean and nothing to worry about for BTC holders, especially in the long run when more and more people learn that leaving your coins out of exchanges eventually lead to continuation of upward price movement (if S&D stay equal and macro eff into acount )"	1

"As a millenial I cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow. How much could colleges charge and get away with? How far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives? Its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place. 

Now that the next gen has seen the effects, they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security. Universities is just way too expensive...on top of that, theres cost of housing and food and transportation. If it were more affordable, I truly believe more kids absolutely would go.

 BUT if someone in that position asked me for advice I would always advise them to at least complete community college and 2 year degrees or certification programs at the very least, in a practical field. Many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs."	0

"I'm from India and here, students can get admission to all the big universities only through an entrance exam. Due to covid the exams were postponed in April (which is the usual time they happen). Now when the country has hit peak infection the Central Government has decided to hold all the exams. At least 30 million students attempt these exams each year. Despite the clamour from the students and Opposition, the Government is proceeding with it. Students have a long list of various concerns that are brushed aside.

1. Due to the rains, many regions are flooded, families displaced and property destroyed.

2. Transportation is nearly impossible. Some States have still not lifted the lockdown, so trains, buses and taxis are either unavailable, or charge exorbitant rates.

3. The Exam Centres are few and far between, particularly in the rural areas. Without means of transportation, students are unable to reach the exam centres. Even if they do manage to arrange for transport, as hotels and restaurants are closed, or open only for takeout, they cannot find safe accomodation

4. Many of the students have applied to multiple universities offering same or similar programs. They all have entrance exams in September. If a student tests positive due to any of these exams, either he cannot take the exam, or he infects hundreds of others when he attempts the paper despite the illness. 

And like always the poor and disadvantaged in the country are suffering the most in this situation.

The government has offered no explanation or assurances for safety This is a no win situation for both students and their families.  The government has no solution that affects millions of students' education and career other than to postpone the exam or hold the exam. This is the state of education in India right now, due to an incompetent government."	1

Hey KRK , you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest. Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work .

Thank you for sharing your invaluable knowledge with us.
Thank you for sharing these great job interview tips. This video is going to help a lot of people including native speakers.
Your videos are just perfect.
P.s I heard that you used the prhase ""a little bit"", I had heard some natives that this is wrong, since ""little"" and ""bit"" means the same thing and it sounds like repetition.
I like to use it ""a little bit"". It sounds fun but some times I feel a little bit uncomfortable thinking if it is correct to use it or not, but if you use it here on a job interview, I know it is correct.??"	2

"I love this guy's videos and have been watching since 2018 but it's unfortunate how they focused on iPhone's strong points and left out some of Android's strong points as well. It's also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones, some astonishing, some horrible. They should've picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS. It should of been a fair fight, but it sadly wasn't. I also don't like how they left out a lot of Android's features like USB-C, newer technology and tricks, and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing. Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this; felt very bias and unfair.

To keep going further, Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here, he was more accepting and less opposing to him, showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD.
To keep going even further, they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot, like the Software Support, which yes Apple has Facetime, iMessage, and more, Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology; and Google message is to Apple's level too. I feel like this video should've had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features.

Great videos, but I'm very disappointed unfortunately, and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years.

>> Final thoughts: This was very bias  towards Apple, this video should've not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it. This video was a comparison on sole facts, so don't stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other. This was expected with Marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with Apple which grows his bias towards them immensely, and that is undeniable fact."	0

This is really an amazing animated video that creates goosebumps and fills every Indian's heart with pride, joy and sadness as well.

Foremost name is Kanaklata Baruah, just a 17 years old girl and she took bullet while hoisting Indian flag and died on the spot. Other freedom fighters are Gopinath Bordoloi, Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, Maniram Dewan, Kushal Konwar, Hem Barua (Tyagbir), Bhogeswari Phukanani. Other prominent freedom struggle unsung heroes from Northeast India are Major Paona Brajabashi, Bir Tikendrajit Singh, Rani Gaidinliu (13 years old Naga girl), Haipou Jadonang, U Tirot Sing Syiemlieh, Moje Riba, U Kiang Nangbah, Pa Togan Sangma. And the list of names doesn't stop here, there are many more. ????????????????????????????????????	2

I have been a data scientist for three years. As a data scientist, one can only be a generalist until and unless he has domain knowledge of the field his company works in. The fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interest/domain of expertise. Moreover, companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science. It's better to be a domain expert and then add skills of data science rather than just being a generalist data scientist without any domain expertise. Hence, I'm leaving data science and starting my PhD ??	1

"As a veteran, I think back to my military service. The oath I took weighs heavily on me right now.

At the time, I wasn't permitted to just say anything that I wanted to. My first amendment right to free speech  wasn't stripped from me, but it was tempered....this wasn't some abysmal violation of my rights, I willingly undertook this at the time.

It's *high* time to pass legislation that holds criminal penalties for candidates and officials who *knowingly* lie in the face of legally established facts and precedent during bids to seek office, and while engaged in the tasks of their office.

This age of obfuscation has to end with a gaveling that won't let th3 weeds grow back. This is toxic to democracy, and if it isn't ended soon, this new face of fascism will take countless lives and damage to unseat once it's entrenchment is complete.

"I would also like to point out that actually *understanding* machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics (as was mentioned as a benefit, being part of something), will be EXTREMELY difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability + statistics. In fact, at my university, in order to enrol in the first machine learning course, you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus (with proofs, as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops), one or two courses in linear algebra, and 2 courses in statistics. 
Thats not to say its impossible to use ML without that, of course it isnt. However, it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge (much more so than with required programming knowledge for ML). 
So yes, you will be a part of something, in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with, but its a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ML publications at a meaningful level, or be generating their own custom models"	1

With all honesty I never imagined someone explaining complex topics with the dexterity this man has. He is literally an institution and an outstanding teacher. 

The computer graphics and the illustrations are simply perplexing. This guy never evades complexity. He never evades complex arguments. He illustrate the complexity and dive into the exhaustive explanation of the details.

1. Structural biology is concerned with the structure of large macromolecules. Amino acids are all small molecules so they fall more under the purview of biochemistry. Your description is almost verbatim one of the sentences from the opening paragraph of the Wikipedia page on structural biology, but I don't think that's correct.

2. Biomedical engineering is the field that makes artificial organs and other medical devices. Biotechnology uses living organisms or their products for our purposes. Synthetic biology creates synthetic organisms and is closely related to biotechnology, but the latter two fields aren't closely related to the first."	0

Para mi, es la plataforma que ha tenido mayores sorpresas en el 2022: The Afterparty, Shining Girls, The Essex Serpent, Black Bird, Pachinko, Severance y recientemente estoy viendo Five Days at Memorial bastante interesante. Agregara tambin que Slow Horses ya tiene grabada su segunda temporada y que estn confirmadas 4, que conforman los libros en los que est basada la serie. ?Saludos lder!	1

"I'm over this channel because 90% of the products they feature in their videos, are on Kickstarter, and honestly at this point they should change the name from, ""Kick Starter""  to ""Never Starter"" LOL????????????, I'm just saying, as I'm also laughing my butt off, because that was hella funny, and it's also hella true, and yes it was also hella shady as well, sorry I couldn't help myself, anyway back to my point, because trust me it's a really good point, and just in case you're still laughing, let me get you back on track, so like I said 90% of the products featured on this channel and it's sister channel, or products that are on Kickstarter, and about 80% to 90% of the products on Kickstarter never even make it to market, that's right you read that correct, and my numbers are correct, because I did my research, so basically this channel, future tech and its sister channel, the future is now, both channels are useless, because over 90% of the products that they show you, you will never ever be able to purchase, so basically honestly it's a waste of everybody's YouTube time, unless you like looking at videos that feature products and gadgets, that will never come to market, and that you will never be able to purchase, seriously on being funny and sarcastic but also serious, because honestly I'm so over it and I'm over this channel, that's why I have unsubscribe and I'm telling everybody else to unsubscribe, so have you unsubscribed, please everybody unsubscribe, because at this point in time future tech and the future is now, and all those channels that display products that are on Kickstarter, and the keyword here is ""display"" because basically all the products are prototypes that are on display, and the public will never be able to buy them because they will never come to market, oh Kickstarter oops I'm sorry I mean never starter, oh my God I'm sorry I couldn't help myself because it's still so funny LOL, ?????? but like I said these products never end up going to market and never end up being sold, so this whole useless channel is a waste of my time and your time and everybody else's time okay, now guess what... time's up so goodbye, and remember everybody please do yourself a big favor and unsubscribe!*????????????????????????"	2

I'm still using my old Pixel 3 and was thinking about buying the pixel 6 when it came out, but it didn't really impress me that much... Looking forward to the Pixel 7 release!

Hope to hear about F4 casting. Theyre going to need the two years.

I'm 17 this year and am studying in an international high school in Shenzhen, China. I was in public school until high school; I'm grateful my parents provided me the opportunity to leave that stressful system. But I heard from my former classmates who are in the system that in recent years, the pressure on that system has been declining, but I can't be assured because I'm no longer in that system. Recalling my dark days in that system, I've always hated it because there was a lot of transcribing homework and memorizing poems and passages. When you fail to remember them, teachers will punish you by transcribing the poems and passages several times. I understand the reason why our government has such a system because we have such a vast population, and I do think it's relatively fair even though its fairness is declining, especially when this double reduction policy came down.	0

Great stuff. I watch several youtube videos on how to trade in the market but haven't made any headstart because they are either talking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it and I do not want to make mistakes by taking risks in my own hands	2

this video arrived at the most opportune moment!!  i started off college (i'm currently a sophomore) with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture. before starting college, i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study, even most of my cousins have studied something stem (science, tech, engineering, and math) related. while i did ok in my first semesters, i felt REALLY depressed and suffocated. my mental health was at its lowest, it was a terrible time for me. i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse. a week ago, i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors, from biochem to english. let me tell you, i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major.	0
Now you know why iJustine always gets stuff because she just smiles and tells you how great the device is.	2
This is the most interesting video I have ever watched about physics in general. Thank you!	2
Thank you so much! Very clear and neat explanation! I hope you will continue diving deeper into detailed concepts rather than concentrating only on basics. Your way of explanation plus the details would be the great video for all I think!	2

"Dr. Peterson, there is another physicist (turned philosopher) who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness, basing himself in his understanding of physics. His name was David Bohm. He is now deceased, but he wrote a book called ""Wholeness and the Implicate Order"" in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation, and which I found very enlightening. I recommend it to you. And while you're at it, you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics, called Bohmian mechanics, since you showed interest in quantum theory. His interpretation gets rid of the inconsistency/incompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way, and in a way which takes all of the apparent ""magic"" out of the theory.

I was fascinated to see that Roger Penrose uses Godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness, since I came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics. So cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man!"	2

"Among the parts of the Indonesian anthem included by Novia Bachmid:
 1.  Lingsir wengi comes from the island of Java especially central Java.
 2.  Cik Cik Periuk comes from the Sambas, West Kalimantan.
 3.  Sinanggar Tulo came from Northern Sumatra.
 4.  Ayo Mama from the Maluku islands.
 5.  Anging Mammiri came from South Sulawesi.
 6.  Lalo Ngaro came from Sasak Lombok East.
 7.  Tanduk Majeng came from the Madura islands.
 8.  The last of our national anthem from Indonesia was the one of Mengheningkan Cipta, Shanna Shannon sang in white between the flames.
The one moment of silence Shannon has sung in memory of all the services our former heroes have fallen before us. The song we used to sing any at the time of the red and white flag ceremony. The song creeps us out every time we listen to it.

The bird that flies over that hill is also the symbol of our country, Indonesia. It's Garuda bird.
The eagle's state symbol also has a particular meaning:
 1.  The Garuda has our country's symbol, Indonesia.
 2.  The Garuda's hoof clings to a single Bhinneka Tunggal Ika when it comes from the book of Sotasoma by the Tantular Emphatti that has different meanings but one is also (tribe, religion, culture, and language).
 3.  The golden yellow represents majesty, constantly charging high in the dignity of a people of great and lofty character.
 4.  The number of feathers on the right and left wing is 17, which means the 17th day our country has been free from Dutch and Japanese rule for 350 years.
 5.  Tail feathers of 8 have the sense of August when we celebrate independence day.
 6.  Below the chain of shields connecting with the tail is the number 19 feather and the hair on the neck 45 (showing the figure of 1945, in which our country of Indonesia was free from the Dutch and Japanese rule in 1945).

The instrument is called Sasando and the hat is called Ti'i Langga. Both are Rote Island, Nusa Tenggara Timur. 

Alffy Rev says that the production of a video clip of the Wonderland Indonesia 2 times will take about 8 months, and early in the song, there are Kecak dancers involved with up to 300.

Thank you for loving our country of Indonesia and for watching it on the 77th year of the Independence Day Republic of Indonesia. 

We are proud to be Indonesians.

"By the way if this hasnt commented yet all the cases in the episode happened in real life or real cases. The was a lawyer who wrote essay about his cases, they bought the copyright from him, and hire him as their consultant as a lawyer to have the perfective of an attorney. This episode focus about being independent from your parent especially going into marriage, remember at the beginning Young Woos father wish that someday her daughter will get married because it all fathers dream to walk their daughter into the aisle and at the end of the episode YW said that if she will get married someday she will not throw the bouquet instead hand it to him so that he can get married since he never have a change to have one and just take care of her which is just the sweetest thought a daughter saying to a single parent so that he will not be lonely. Then our bride finally have the guts to be free from her fathers grasped because he is controlling her so much that she doesnt have the say if she is arranged to be married. 
Lastly JunHo and Min Woo are friends and flatmates they are not gays???? anyway you will find out in the coming episodes."	1
"Another thing I've found helpful as a CS major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gen-ed classes (subjects like History, English, Philosophy, etc.). Having a spare 100-level ""Intro to X"" class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of Java/Python can really defray the pressure. Many of these are also just as good when taken online as well!"	2

My mother used my successes as her gauge to show approval and basic humanity. It was never enough for her to show love, only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that I was a complete failure. Take it from me, dont push your children towards your goals; it only teaches them that they arent good enough to make it on their own. I was successful in school and was the first in my family to get a degree, but I was also the most miserable, sad child of all 10 of us kids. Is that success? I know it isnt.	0

"A good video as always! As a CS major myself, this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section! Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info:

1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn't computer engineering.

2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.

3) 0 doesn't actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an ""off"" state at 0 volts. We wouldn't want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off! There are also other uses for this state, but this may be covered in a future video."	2

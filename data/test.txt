Thank you so much for making these videos. Your videos gave me the confidence I needed in an interview. I was so nervous to have a interview in a research management position, but your videos helped to calm me down and give me the confidence and the answers to help me get the job. I was hired on the spot. Thank you again!	2

I come from a physics background, and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory, trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can. A lot of colleagues in my department don't understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop. During my masters I realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity, which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects. Now that I'm finishing my masters and starting to get into ML engineering I see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want. Amazing content you put there, mate! Thanks from Brazil!	2

First one works thanks to friction, when the imbalance occurs friction cancels out the speeds on each side which kind of forces you to move them accordingly so that the momentum on the sides are equal.	1

"This is what we need more of people from different views talking it out and hearing what the other has to say and even if it gets heated they can both shake hands in the end and see the others as equals, too often nowadays nobody wants to hear what the ""otherside"" has to say, they just want to shut it down by saying that their side is better than the other and nothing more"	0

Dear Andrea, I was thoroughly impressed by your welcoming, warm attitude and your gracious and warm attitude when you lost. I think that the way you played and engaged young Kai will stay with him for the rest of his life. You may not be (at this time) the number one chess player in the world, but I think you're doing something far more important: you're winning the hearts of these children and that is a gift that will stay with them for life. Thank you for sharing.	2

I said it a million times and I will always do, David Howel is the most under-rated chess player in the whole world.

Everyone in crypto right now, especially on Twitter are ultra focused on the bear and further downward pressure.

Personally, I also have conviction and totally click with what you are saying about gaming.., I know the market will return but for now I am not interested in talking about price, more so what is being built.

So many exciting projects like Defi Kingdoms, Star Atlas and many more.. all building through the bear. Even your own projects.

Yes, this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding. For anyone that's getting deeper into learning web dev stuff, I highly recommend Scrimba. It has a great problem-solving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what you've learned together instead of just showing you the solution first. There's also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloud-based coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so it's very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor. You can pause it at any time and directly edit the code that's being written during the tutorial.	2

Im most excited for the watch as well! I was using iPhones for about 9 years until I switched to the Pixel.

I applied for a job the day after recognizing sexual assault in my recent past, during the interview the interviewers asked me what was something difficult recently that Ive faced in my life and how did I overcome it, I was very much in a vulnerable state of mind and couldnt help but to talk about the freshest thing on my mind, the sexual assault I cringe very hard thinking back on it, but I did get the job and its an amazing job	2

Your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me. I too pride my self in character building and story telling. Those are my passions what keeps me making my game. This being my first game youre other tip was perfect, I should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story / dream game. This video hit at the perfect time for me, and thank you for your content. One question about your stories, do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go, drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art?	2

I'm beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity. There's place of brashness, boldness, creativity, fear, light touch, nimbleness, anger, bluffs. It is a beautiful game, rich with stunningly creative ideas and tactics. It has stood the test of time because each generation realizes in greater depth than the previous one, how many more things are possible in a game, how far ahead can pieces support each other, how deep and far-seeing ideas can be, and how rich a battlefield it is to display the full range of human cleverness and emotions.	2

No love for Pragmata? Im really looking forward to see more of that game, specially some gameplay since the concept of the only trailer we have is so trippy. Im personally looking forward for some STALKER 2, Atomic Heart and Pragmata.	2
Believe it or not Im getting a bit emotional watching this. I was fascinated by chess as a kid, but I was useless at it and got discouraged. My dad tried to teach me, but that mostly involved a lot of yelling, swearing, and tears. This is the first time Ive seen someone explain the game with such clarity, enthusiasm, patience, and obvious love for the game. At 32, hopefully this is the beginning of a new chess journey for me. Thankyou so much.	2

I love that Mr. Jake Tapper is shining a light  on the deceptive practices by a bunch of the politicians and moreover  that he very clearly states it's not okay. Some  politicians (and even some of us voters) have over time experienced an eroded sense of right and wrong. It's helpful to call attention to this  because we as a nation need to start somewhere to recapture a normal good sense of ethics. Right and wrong matter to build a prosperous economy.	1

"I have a decent amount of physical games from the original Xbox, 360, and one so I feel justified getting the Series X especially because it has superior fps at 4K resolution. The problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series X to its limits yet. If you still have a one X and plan to get a Series X later and can wait, you can update the Internal HDD to a SDD on the One X. Itll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the Series S. The One X has a better graphics card than the series S, previous games optimized for the One X will look better on the One X than on the series S. However cross platform games are probably going to have a better FPS than the X do to the better CPU. Theres a lot that goes into this stuff. 

Another factor to consider is the quality of your tv. Ill be looking to pair my Series X with a new OLED tv here soon and then Im 200% sure Ill feel justified with the purchase.

Also I game a lot so 30, 60, 120 frames a second I notice the difference. And in no way shape or form would I feel justified having a next gen console (Series S) that cant even keep up with my old 4K tv."	2

Life hits hard. It hits everybody again and again, like tides against the shore. Get up. Another wave is coming, but thats just fine because you are strong. Get up. I know you fell down before, and that's just fine. Get up. You're going to keep falling down, of course you are, that's all the more reason to get up again, because that's what you're made of. You are not being measured by how tall you can stand, but by how many times you can get up before you give up. Run until your legs give out, swim until you drown, climb until you fall, life is short. Endure the agony that comes because it can't last. Why not see just how far you can go? I believe in you. Im running too. Im climbing too. Im swimming until I can't anymore. I refuse to drown. Stay here with me, be my brother, be my sister. We will fight for each other.	2

"This video has made my heart seethe with rage. As a white young adult myself, my great grandfather experienced the hardships of sharecropping, and I regret every day that he is not with us for me to learn and record his experiences. On an even worse level, the ignorance of my grandfather's generation on the peonage system and their tendency to spout black criminality rhetoric saddens me. It amazes me how racism can fester so immensely with even the most impoverished folk... My thoughts and prayers go out that future generations take the important duty of learning this history in a more complete manner than mine.

Your line delivery in this video is outstanding. Your passion and sincerity in your presentation of these sad facts shows just how good of a man you are. Bravo! And may every man and woman of every nation know these and all other historical horrors for the betterment of tomorrow and beyond..."	0

Id rather have games be delayed for as long as its necessary to make them as good and as bug-free as possible. They should just stop announcing games until theyre nearing completion instead of hyping up something up when its merely a concept or in early development.

Imo something that's Extremely underrated, especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on. Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects. Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects, and it makes your code more modular (each class/game object is its own self contained thing). Singleton and Factory patterns, as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into. Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things. If you're using Unity, learn to use Unity events/C# events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects.	2

Shane, I would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information. I looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science. Usually people will go into something like Business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale. Also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs. For instance in IT career questions even though IT may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of $15-$20 an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin.	2

My 1st console was the original PS.  Loved it so much that I stayed with them and upgraded to PS2.  Somewhere in there I picked up a used xbox because my 1st Lan party with Halo just blew me away.  Then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what I was willing to spend at that time so I turned to Nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems.  Getting the Xbox series X was an easy decision for me.  I have Nintendo Switch for my exclusives, strategy, and rpg needs while the Xbox satisfied my craving for FPS and games that required higher processing and graphical power.	2

"Im 35, and I love how, when I was in high school, it was thought of as impractical to become a game developer by most of our parents. I remember being convinced that ""computer stuff is more of a hobby than something you can make a career out of."" And many of us believed them and decided to go to school for something else. Years later, though, some of us have finally decided to take the leap and make a career change. For years, Ive wanted to learn how to code, but I always thought I wasnt smart enough to actually learn how, so I never even tried until the end of last year. Now, my only regret is that I didnt start learning 20 years ago. But Ive learned so much is this past year!

Although< I have interests in global economics I don't watch the news anymore... I have enough FUD.  Thanks for this news and offering your insight on how to navigate during unfortunate times/events like this.  You're right about keeping level headed when investing so that's why I think it's important to limit the amount of FUD we consume.  I don't watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if I were to watch the news everyday.

I was a Computer Science major but I switched to Computer Engineering last year.

"The Odyssey is Homer un-writing the Iliad. When Odysseus raids, cheats, and behaves generally like a Iliadic hero he is at his weakest (and at the beginning of his odyssey). By the end he refuses to cheat on his wife with the incredible fantastic Nausica, he shows almost inhuman patience and self-control in the face of the suitors' abuse, and he choses nostos over kleos, the choice Achilles couldn't stand to make. What's more, Achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the Iliad when Odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead, by saying that ""it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead.""

And he doesn't ""lie to everyone he knows."" His Cretan narratives are really important, non-violent defenses against a situation similar to Agamemnon and Clytemnestra.?"	0

A couple of my distant German family members were at Stalingrad, and are still there as far as I know. None of the family know when or where they died exactly, but there are Oak trees planted on the family land as a memorial. I only learnt this while looking through family history, trying to learn more about my roots. They were barely in their 20's, conscripted and sent to fight. I'm now older than they were, and I couldn't imagine going through that sort of living hell. I understand they were on the 'wrong' side, and I absolutely respect the Russians for defending their homeland, but whenever I hear the word Stalingrad, it makes me think of those guys. War is a waste, so much potential in humanity just thrown away at the whims of the people in power.	0

The hard part about Machine Learning is not the how but the what. I can plot learning curves very easily, but reading them is another story.

This is a little less crazy then some other people, but me and one of my closest friends met in the 9th grade. One weekend we both were going to our grandparents houses, and we found out that way that we were only a half a street away from each other. Another crazy aspect was that my mother and her father had both grown up in those houses, and had attended the same elementary, middle, and high school exactly 10 years apart. He had also seen my mother's house being built. Kind of crazy!	2

I started reading again this year. I was probably only reading 2-3 books a year for several years straight. For a literature course, I had to read  Persuasion by Jane Austen.  I fell in love with it and finished it in a day. It's also very short compared to her other novels. It kick-started my reading again and I've read 20  books so far this year! Not a crazy number compared to other's, however that's a huge leap from only 2 books a year.	2

"I collected many books in my private collection which described ancient or the modernity of social class. Many literature books and even modern varieties are ancient statue books which are resolvable when including digital funding approaches. These dilemmas of history and authors still contained there made notice how fermented literature problems are there in this genre with desceptive and complicated writing. Most of these author problems are about lacking taxation for their publications and can all be solved with basic cultural sufficiency. The only books left clearly are books of biological, axiom measurement and important areas. The rest is left in boring light if the hysterical problem always has the same solution.
You will read these admirable criticisms untill you start to complain for your justice and indicate in the ecosystem. The only thing you notice is that the same countires and ecosystems require your depth and a basic sufficiency in more publications."	1
Wow. ???????????? Just finished your tutorial, it took me somewhere between three and four hours to go through it because I stopped it all the time to try out almost everything you had just presented, in order to remember things better, and while doing so actually discovered a few more things. I also appreciated some of your design ideas which further opened my eyes to the endless possibilities Canva offers. I had already watched a number of other tutorials, some also very well presented, but most are way too short: they just awaken your curiosity but then leave you hanging there, struggling. After having worked through your tutorial, I feel that I hit the ground running, and am now off to your other tutorials to learn more.

"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25+ Crores for a movie. Even highly educated Proffesionals (CA's, Engineers, Doctors, Civil Servants etc) do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service. 

A simple logic, if theses actors (Including the Kumars, Khan's, Devgans, Kapoor's, Roshans, etc) start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie,  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price.

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100+ Crores and secured the life's of their children and grandchildren. They are living king-size life with our hard earned money. I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app"	0

I've been studying with the traditional academia style from my chidhood and I think this was one of the reasons of my deep unhappiness everytime I had to go to the school, and I agree the system can be totally useless when it comes to study died things in only books and not providing experiential oportunities to learn for children. Its a very serious matter that I hope will dramatically change very soon. I adapted to the system and became succesful in the studies but I can tell not in life. Sharing my experience, all the best to you guys	0

"Excellent, data-driven assessment of this field.  I am 57 with a BS in math just retired (not really, want to work in data science) and pursuing a masters in statistics.  I have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty. Most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens.  I was able to start on Zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although I keep fit and positive (I never lied about my age - that would be creepy but didn't need to advertise it either so long as I pulled my weight in study groups).  I feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best I can.  You mentioned ageism and while I have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet I have experienced ageism and how one's ""value"" can diminish at a job.  The brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating.  Me, I'll keep on going until I cannot.  I enjoy turning data into knowledge.  I am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos.  Either way, keep the data and its interpretation flowing and ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light!"""	2

"I'm bingewatching various tech giants headquarters and Apple's spaceship was the first I saw. It was overwhelmingly beautiful. It was sleek, sophisticated, and very modern (with all its curtain glass and symmetrical plan)

Until I saw Facebook's, Google's, Microsoft's, and Samsung's (which was almost like a city) and I was more captivated at how it ""take care of its employees"" by making their design asymmetrical, free-flowing, playful, and carefree rather than projecting sleekness and ""rigidness""  which more often than not creates a ""museum"" vibe where you'll feel scared to move that you'll stumble and break something and doesn't really help whatsover to boost creativity and productivity for its employees. (not to mention the ridiculously expensive materials used for that)

Overall, the headquarters and its facilities speaks volumes of what philosophy they have in creating and selling their products to people."	2

To the people saying that growing bonsais is torture, I just want to say that many of the training methods are also applies in other tree nurseries, where the trees for parks, streets and gardens are grown. They are repotted, pruned (the roots too), wired and they get limited amounts of nutrients in order to grow into the desired shape. Of course, it isn't neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger, but as long as they are kept healthy I don't see a problem with it. I think that few wild trees actually have the resources to grow to their full potential, and especially not the ones that grow in urban settings.	1

Im very happy with my Series S, and Ive been all about physical media before I got it. I do plan on getting a series X eventually, but Ive just been playing digital games on my Xbox One most of the time because of Game Pass Ultimate. After thinking about it, I realized my physical library on Xbone was substantially smaller than my PS4 library or Switch library, so I didnt really feel bad about getting the Series S and an external hard drive. Even though my 360 library was pretty big, Ive been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like $3 each digitally. When the Series X becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper, Ill get one but for now Im really enjoying my Series S	2

I love the original Tamil movie. The Tamil version solidified Vijay Sethupathy as my favorite actor. The whole concept of setting up the story in the Vikram Vetal backdrop was so unique. The climax fight- Vedha has a 'come what may'/ unhinged/ chaotic attitude- and the crazy banter between Vikram and Vedha during the fight .. it was absolutely fresh to look at... Personally I love both Saif and Hrithik. I really don't want to compare VJS and Hrithik. I'll be honest, I was skeptical about the remake. But the teaser does look promising. I love Hrithik's attempt at being the unhinged 'Vedha'. Except for the accent, as you rightly pointed out, the teaser does look promising. Even though the bgm is very good, I was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head! I do miss it... I really really really hope and pray this movie does well...	2

I sincerely appreciate the work you've done and the knowledge you share. Technical analysis can be helpful, but I think It is quite puzzling that well-known cryptocurrency YouTubers just pay attention to pure T.A and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems. Ignoring the reality that each ETF launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from BTC highs is somewhat dangerous. We were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly  whale pumps. Day trading should be given greater consideration because it is less affected by the market's situation.  trading daily with LIBERTONCORP I have earned over $ 12BTC using his insights and charts. His insight has always been a step ahead of others..	1
I now have a whole new appreciation for having learned history at school and having had some great teachers and lecturers once I got to University. With history, there's never only one true answer for every question you ask because everyone views the world differently, from culture to culture, religion to religion, even between generations, which is why history gets revised so much to answer the questions that each era asks. You're free to come up with any ideas of your own so long as you have the evidence to back it up.	2

If inflation stay at current level soon or later the bond market will collapse, then following will be the collapse of stock market. There is no other option but to keep tightening money supply until inflation back to sustainable level. This is the effect of 20 years of horrific monetary policy (QE + too much stimulus). The FED added 25 trillions of debt to it balance sheet since 2000 and all the plans to reduce it deficit have failed and in the contrary they continue to increase the deficit each year. They can blame the Ukraine War or COVID that caused inflation but the reality is just poor monetary policy made by the central government over decades. The only question left is how much tightening they can do without causing a hard recession in an already vulnerable economy.	0

"It's been a hard year, this was really nice to chill to while scrolling through some motivational quotes to get my going :)
reminder: if you are someone like me; someone who is kind of a perfectionist, or if u think ur life isn't ""good enough"" or ""messy""
here's some motivation: life is supposed to be messy, that's what makes life, 'life'. ""the way I see it if you want to see the rainbow you've got to put up with the rain"" -unknown. life is basically an adventure, there and ups and downs and smooth roads. won't it be boring if your life went EXACTLY the way you wanted it? the hard times are an experience, and the present time is a moment to appreciate.
so let's appreciate this beautiful life together, whatever you are going through, you will get through it. The rainbow will be across your head at the right time

"LMGs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for, this IS the content we want to watch.

Thank you for another enjoyable recap. You seem moderately exhausted and mildly disheartened, but the fact of the matter is you kept it close against an experienced ~2600 GM.

I was thinking about becoming a game developer who primarily creates code as a hobby. I don't like the art side of it. I figure I would rather download sprites from websites and use those for a 2D indie game. I am learning JavaScript and I was thinking about using three.js and JavaScript for creating a nice small 2D game. Maybe for mobile and importing it to React-Native. I am guessing this will take me another 4 months of learning JavaScript before I am able to program my first small game. I am learning JavaScript for web development, but I think I will at the end pivot into mobile development.	1

They could introduce a group of Mutants that has huge ties to the X-men, especially Wolverine. Bring in Alpha Flight and at the end have a cut scene of Heather and James on a hunting trip and encountering a wild beast in the woods. They don't even have to show his face, not revealing who the actor is. This could lunch into the X-men Movie where Xavier is  recruiting the new team to battle Karoka to rescue the original team. They could do flash backs for the first half giving us the true original roster. I always fear that the X-men movie will feature the more popular members rather than establishing the original 5 and later Havok and Polaris. I don't mind having the most popular members, but stay true to the originals. Hated when Fox screwed it all up. And Rogue WAS A VILLIAN before joining the X-men.	1

"My underestanding is that the wife wasn't going to survive either way. So it was a matter of ""letting the gods take them both"" or actively killing his wife to save the baby. An absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it. We've seen some horrible stuff, but her death scene was up there with one of Ramsay's scenes. I also think, given recent political events in the US, it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from Marvel. Not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come.

Also, I hear this series will be far more morally grey than Game of Thrones ever was. Daemon gives me Ramsay or Joffrey vibes, but he'll be much more complex and less villainous. While he seems to operate on self-motivation, his violence isn't wanton or random like Joffrey or Ramsay. So I picture him being closer to a Cersei/Jaime style character. But if anything he absolutely gives PEAK Targaryen vibes and Matt Smith gives a stellar performance.

I'm really excited to see Corlys Valaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen. A shame we haven't seen much of Rhaenys but I picture her having some of Cersei's chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown. I hate to touch on this, but I know Corlys's racial ""change"" was of concern, and I originally had slight concern myself. Not because some ""OMG WOKE"" bs, but because of the Velaryons and the Targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation, so I prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one. But if you think about it, the light complexion of the Targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins. Furthermore, Valyria was awfully close to the Summer Isles and Sothoryos. So to me, Corlys is more what I would envision the original Valyrians would look like, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Especially after seeing him on screen. He seems like a GREAT character already and I think (and hope) he's up there with Davos.

 Otto Hightower gives strong Tywin and Littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all. He *does* seem like a *type* of man-of-honor, but more in the sense of being a strict rule-follower stuck in the old ways.

And then obviously Viserys is the Ned Stark of the series. I LOVE seeing that name reclaimed. And while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity, I'm glad he apologized to Rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her. I especially like that when brought up with the council, the first response was ""There's never been a queen"" but one of the others was quick to chime in with ""Only out of precedent and tradition"". It's nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has ""hah, but she's a WOMAN!"" Maybe Rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had.

Also while the age difference between him and Alicent is a little insane, and I don't like Otto pimping out his daughter like that, I do think they would legitimately treat each other well. Probably erring on the side of Viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it.

Most of all, the show felt like we jumped straight into S3 or S4 of Game of Thrones."	0

Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge.	2

"What parents expect from us during school:

Constant Straight As.
Good social life.
All that.


What they dont expect:

Stress
Depression
Social Awkwardness



School just sucks. Having to determine all self worth on a high or low grade just makes you upset and then fear what happens as a consequence.
I hate how parents dont understand that school can genuinely give a child depression, and mental health issues because they REFUSE to think like their child: they always say that we arent depressed, just faking it for attention.

I had a mental breakdown once, all I was asked was why did I cry. And that there had to be a reason.

This talk was very healing for me. I had some difficult experiences with science as a middle schooler. I was placed in advanced english and science classes, but I never really got science. I was made fun of by my teacher. From that experience I came to believe that me and science don't mix. But now that I'm older I realize I do love science when its explained well and when it relates to something I care about. I really do want to learn about Quantum physics, but have been intimidated about where to start. Your simple little explanations opened a door for me Dominic. I send you love and appreciation across the quantum waves.	2

"Thutmose III was a child when his father, Thutmose II died in 1479 BC. His stepmother and aunt Hatshepsut became regent during his minority but was herself declared pharaoh within a couple of years. Although Thutmose III was not deposed, he would remain powerless during Hatshepsut's reign. In theory he and his stepmother were co-rulers, but in practice his position was nebulous and he was kept out of the way as Hatshepsut ruled Egypt. Thutmose III was also married to Hatshepsut's daughter to further consolidate his claim to the throne. Its believed that Thutmose III resented Hatshepsut for sidelining him in the first 22 years of his reign, and after Hatshepsut died indulged himself in a bit spite that was aimed at his stepmother when he tore down her statues and removed her images from temples and other important structures.

Thutmose III was considered very studious and he studied a lot during his aunt's tenure as pharaoh and he became widely respected for his learning. At this time he also gained renown as commander of the army and made a name for himself as a good general who was also wise in victory. All the while Egypt under Hatshepsut experienced a period of growth and security, which the nation needed. Trade routes were re-established and the economy grew by leaps and bounds. This was the beginning of the wealth for which Egypt is now famous for."	1

Tip # 3 - Don't make your first game your dream game. It should be your 15 minute crap game. You'll figure out your strengths.
Tip # 4 - Focus on prototyping. It's easier to build in pieces, and funding will motivate you.
Tip # 5 - Build a community. Discord and Social Media."	1

The One X is still a very relevant console as it does Native 4K on many games, even if it is a stable 30fps. And even some at 60fps, mostly MS titles. Digital Foundry even said graphical differences are very miniscule, and for the most part it would take a magnifying glass to spot the differences. Which is true since I've compared both side by side. When they get MUST HAVE next gen titles ONLY it'll probably be worth it. As of now the One X...AND Pro are just fine. On a 4K display.	2

One question:  you seemed to make a point of mentioning more than once that protists are unicellular, yet I was under the impression that protists (being the grey area they are as you mentioned) include all eukaryotes that are considered neither Animalia, Plantae, nor Fungi.  I was also under the impression that some of these Protista are indeed multicellular.

That footage of the finless shark plummeting to the sea floor was appalling. I'm incredibly glad you showed it, but it's appalling. I'm not outright against the killing of animals, but the combination of outright cruelty and waste is just mind bending. I struggle with how humans can so easily disconnect from certain realities (I struggle with how I see it in myself as well). A fisherman would know that these sharks would still be alive when they're thrown back in, if they just stopped to even think about what they're doing. If they're hellbent on wasting the rest of the shark, just slit the damn thing's throat before you throw it back, you sick fuck	0

Thanks< for the update and keep doing what you do. My journey in the current market has taught me a lot of lessons, at the top of that list is that it never pays to live above one's means. I have managed to grow a nest egg of around $600k to a decent 7 figures in the space of a few months. Sad to say but a lot of us have poor money management skills. My 2 cents -get an advisor to keep you accountable and aid you make better decisions, Carolyn Halles has been helping me a lot, all through my journey. I find it better to pay a little bit more for peace of mind than worry about money or market trends and still get burned.	2

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems.

We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts.

"Went to North Carolina for my cousin's wedding back in October 2018. Mentioned that we were going to go to Bojangles the following day. We had two people at our table that were close friends of the bride and groom (the groom being my cousin). They immediately got excited and told us we had to go there. It holds the record for being the only place whose biscuits I love.

Everyone was so worried about him (Magnus) not taking it seriously. When he showed clearly it didn't matter how you look during a match. The board speaks for itself. TO MY FELLOW CHESS PLAYERS...PLAY THE BOARD NOT THE PERSON. Also If they didn't want anyone expressing they're facial expressions and such they would have made the tournament traditional and face to face. This chess society has so much to improve on when it comes to JUST PLAYING THE BOARD. The point of this game is whose mind is stronger. Who ever has the advantage in the META wins always.

NDTV presenters should research schemes all over the World!!! before debating with PTR sir....which are called people's welfare schemes, not freebies... My son gets free education in the UK schools (though we are expats), including meals.....UK government does not call it freebies.....The media should question the bank loan waivers.....given to corporates....not people's welfare schemes. Of course, NDTV will not debate since they are also funded by corporates...The anchor tries to talk about Television distribution by DMK... It was a huge reform to uplift people from low-income strata and brought changes...maybe anchor.. when she was young, did not watch TV from neighbors window who are rich....there are numerous positives...during covid, the TN state education ministry ran special channels for the students for online classes on the subjects in schools...and poor children who did not have smartphone benefitted..... and the only drawback from this Television freebie was people saw nonstop news channels like NDTV and believed India against corruption movement and the circus....and voted out congress and DMK...in 2014.	0

"We keep saying ""It's the Magnus effect"" (not talking about basketballs and dams here....) but would be interesting to test this. In an esport I follow, (Age of Empires 2) one player (TheViper) was so dominant for so long that a streamer (T90Official) came up with the idea of an event he called Hidden Cup where everyone's identities were hidden and only revealed at the end. Each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who. Was a really interesting concept, as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who. They've repeated the format 4 times now, which says something about how loved it is. But with chess being an online thing now, this kind of event is very possible and I think would be fascinating. Would Magnus still win? (TheViper did, so proved that theory wrong at least for him!)"	2

4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance.

"Working as a PhD in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data... and it always shocks me how little they know. I'd say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it (that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem). 

My understanding are the best skills to have are 1) be able to identify problems 2) be able to decide how to solve the problem. Once that is done, usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial (though potentially data cleaning is time consuming). But honestly, don't trust me. I had to go do a PhD because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff..."	0

"I <,watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint.. Keep going. You've reminded me of what someone once said The mind is the man, the poor is in it and the rich is it too"". This sentence is the secret of most successful investors. I once attended similar and ever since then I have been waxing strong financially and I most tell you the truth. The bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month. They have managed to push the price by more than 100%. The majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction, begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical $2K level. One thing is certain, nobody knows what is going on. Our leadership in the country couldnt be any worse, from the press to the feds, they are all terrible. They say you cant time the market, but this one was easy to see coming. Every man , woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance. Doesnt matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check / checks ASAP. That's the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains. It's unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation, things has been so difficult but BTC/ETH trading has helped me maintain financial stability. Although I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mr. James Wilson, he is a genius and that is why I always advise beginners/investors to trade with professionals like him. So far I have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 1.07 btc to atop 13.01 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by James and I'm an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy. You all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on ?eI???m??

An important caveat is that when interviewing anyone, you need to establish a baseline for their individual body language. Maybe they are naturally more nervous or nervous because of the situation. So you first ask questions you already know answers to to see how they react. Watch how they move when they tell the truth. Figure out their normal. Then, you can ask calculated questions and see if there is deviation. You are looking for *clusters* of indicators - not isolated indicators.	1

Consciousness is also the ability to tap into the collective consciousness around you, like when someone looks at you in a crowded place and you look back at them at exactly the same time..   thats not random or chance, theres an extra intelligence at work there that we cant really prove yet.

That's why Magnus really wanted to face a new generation player in the WCC since he knew they had more chances than the players of his generation.

"That glass pane-beacon thing was neat, I liked that. Though I find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general. I kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam. I know Vanilla Tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me, but that doesn't mean EVERYONE isn't seeming my base just SURROUNDED in beams. Maybe they could make tinted glass function as a ""beam nullifier"" while still maintaining effects? That'd be nice."	2

"THANK YOU RICHARD!
Thanks to your tips, templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy I managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience. The twist is I was informed day prior to the interview that I will have to talk in my native language ( which I only use to speak to my family for many years now ) instead of english. So I translated my answers, went to the thing and landed the job! They even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety. I went to your site too, really good content! So thank you again!

To all who are got an interview ahead- PRACTICE PRACTICE and then PRACTICE more. Watch Richard's videos, personalise your answers, list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order. Better yet, visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down, sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview. That helped me great deal, even though there was a point I wanted to run away I had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning. Good luck all!"	2

They are smart to opt out. I've been going to school my entire life. I'm 48 and enjoy learning. There is no difference between high school and community colleges. There is also no guarantee you will find work with a degree. Just because you have a degree doesn't mean your work is good. Professors will rarely tell you if your portfolio is good because they don't care. The institution they work for already have their money. Technical colleges used to be different but they too are falling into the hands of CEO executives who think they know how to run a college. Colleges also don't let teachers teach. The price of education is NOT worth it. You get a better education from the University of Youtube, which most teachers use to teach.	1

Hey, something that might interest you. A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well. Just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely don't tell you this when you buy your hardware and services.	0

"They referenced the White Walker prophecy at the end. When the King was talking to his daughter. Seems its a warning passed from king to king. Little did they know it took 172 years to come to pass. And the King even says, A Targaryen has to be on the throne to win that Cold War!
Yes, its rumored the throne rejects those who arent worthy by cutting them!
This whole series will show us how such a powerful family like the Targaryens become the died off long lost house we see in Season 1 of GoT. When Daenerys was with her brother cast out and ridiculed. 
So were gonna see what they did to themselves to become that so low and from 10 dragons on total around in this series, to Dragons no longer even exist! In GoT and are old rumors. 
Each Targaryen pairs with a dragon, either a new one or one passes down from a deceased relative. There are young and old dragons, dragon eggs, trainers and keepers! So cool"	1

But I just can't resist when you're calling

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours

Looks great!  The bakery where I work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins - for dairy we use sour cream rather than milk/buttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla, but otherwise very similar!  Someone has maybe already commented this, but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup (for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect) of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking.  Blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo!	2

I am very excited to see what happens now that Johnny has moved on to something else. It took some getting used to but I really like watchOS along with iOS and iPadOS. Sometimes I think Apple keeps a certain product like the iPhone X or Apple Watch Series 3 supported way too long. One thing that forces you to get a new Apple Watch is when the battery starts malfunctioning. That has happened to me twice. I have the same Apple TV that you were talking about that needs to be discontinued. I have not had any issues with it so I have no reason to complain except I do believe they need a new high definition Apple TV. My TV does not support 4K. When Apple stops supporting this particular TV model, I will definitely upgrade. Although my new TV has AppleTV built into the App Store, I cannot find the ESPN or MLB applications and I have not found a Visio App Store.	2

"Computer Science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them. And while you can learn programming/development by watching a bunch of Youtube videos, if you lack the basic CS knowledge, you will always struggle to make technical choices & come up with a poor/suboptimal design. While this is understandable that for some people the CS curriculum means a lot of depth which it certainly is, it has big rewards on your software engineering job once you learn it well. 
It is easy to supplement knowledge related to the latest trending technology, but if you have knowledge gaps in your fundamentals, you're gonna have a hard time overcoming those."	2

"Becoming ARMY truly is a life-changing experience, and one that anyone who hasn't done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand. I would have never thought that at the age of 54 I would become such a huge fan and supporter of the ""boyband"" my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point. 2 years later, almost to the day, and I look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that 7 young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me. Because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves, they have zero understanding and they all think I'm crazy, I think. All I can think is how sad it is that they won't give them a chance and experience the same thing I have. I like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is BTS. You guys are that kind of reactor and it's wonderful to see."	2

At 83, I'd like to believe that kids will always remain curious about the mathematical world.	2

"I was impressed by how more often than not that it actually felt like People interacting onscreen and not CGI Hulk Animations. The montage/action in most CGI scenes I feel use so much motion blur that they're just...well...blurry. There was a bit of that here, but overall it's becoming more naturalistic. Dig it.
Eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the ""need"" to add every frame between the movements for smoothness, when there isn't much smoothness AT ALL to eye movement. They did a good job with the eyes for sure. 
This has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video, but just throwing in 2 cents ; - )"	2

"As someone who is working in the Data Analytics side, I wholeheartedly agree with this. Data science is a new field which basically supports or optimizes how to do business. Software engineering leans more on building software or applications where normal people can use/consume. If you want to create your own business in the tech industry, software engineering should be necessary. If you want to support existing businesses, data science is the way.

I'm planning to create my own business on the food industry and I can see that data science can help it a lot."	2

The more you learn, the more intriguing it gets. The video quotes 3 top experts in AI, neuroscience and physics and they all see great complexity and uncertainty in the consciousness issue. 
I've realised that it's possible to slightly misinterpret the video if you don't watch it all - sorry. I'm not accepting everything the AI says about consciousness - I cover the issue near the end.

The dark side of Google is still brighter than many others' best offerings. What you are saying is true, accurate, and necessary. Let's put that in context. I get paid to work hard comfortably making a substantial salary and the downside is I can either create my own company, work for one of my co-workers who create a company or stay where I am getting paid a strong salary. There are many companies who wish they had those problems to offer. They have the same demands, wants, and expectations but few if any of the benefits. Google's dark side is 6am in the morning dark. You do not even need a flashlight.	2

Mike is awesome.  I wish he had a follow-up for teaching advanced C++.  

I just love his way of teaching, its excellent.  Precise, not overly wordy and simple, and the best thing is he runs his query after every example so we can clearly see the output.  

Seriously he is the best.  Great speaker and presenter.

Edit:  Just a note, but Mike even explained loops which also occur in SQL and its something I honestly havent ever really fully grasped before but because of this video I finally get it.  This actually is going to positively effect my job too, not just my hobby.  

Just wonderful teaching."	2

"A render engine is what makes stuff appear on the screen. Usually using ray-casting (like ray tracing but without the bouncing off of objects), it detects what it hits, and then displays that to the screen (this is probably one of the most common ways of doing this but their might be otherways, correct me if im wrong. ty)

The only thing I've seen with render engines is with Blender and it's Eevee, Cycles, and Workbench render engines."	1

DON'T LET ANYONE DECEIVE YOU. First hand experience...Google is by far the best place to work among all the FAANG or tech companies...not everyone resides in California just incase of commute and nobody will force you to stay behind work hour. As an adult I eat 2 times a day, brunch and dinner. All my friends either work for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, LinkedIn, Nutanix.  We always discuss life work balance.  Google is the best place to work on the surface of the earth (my opinion). People leave their jobs because of bad mangers and high expectations that leads to burn out. That's why we have hybrid and remote (work from home).	2

"When I went to school in the sixties, there was one program, one track, and it all revolved around completing workbooks, memorizing facts and spewing them back in exams, and in addition being judged on academic performance (if memorizing and spewing dates and other facts counts as performance), we were given a grade for ""citizenship."" A good grade in citizenship meant you didn't give the teachers any trouble: you had learned to go along to get along. A bad grade meant you were Trouble, and got a lot of negative attention from the vice principal. I spent most of school, particularly middle school, in terror of making someone mad, or being different. It was a hateful experience."	1

This video is super helpful! A fantastic sequel to this would be 46 easiest SAT math problems because the easy ones show up more often, and you can still get them wrong if you use the wrong approach. I am not looking to get a perfect score. So, my goal is to focus on getting the easy/medium ones correct and salvage some of the more difficult ones. However, I know I am not the only one who is frustrated with getting 'easy' problems incorrect on the SAT. Therefore, this would be an excellent video for those looking to be in the 600-700 range for the math section, rather than 700-800.	2
"The thing that was not mentioned in the video is that there are two Mcdonalds in India. North and East zone run by connaught foods and south and west run by Hardcastle foods. The menus for both of them are different meaning each of them have their own exclusives.. I think Nikhil was having the south and west mcdonalds. They have a bigger menu compared to North and East.

Indian laws donot allow foreign companies to hold 100% of business in India. They are required to partner up with a local company.
so,
McDonalds partners with connaught foods and Hardcastle foods
Dominos with jubilant foods
Yum brands partner with Devyani International, Sapphire Foods and more recently Burman Hospitality
Starbucks with TATA coffees. 
etc.

so the local companies do get a say in the menus which is why the menus may be different at different places in India"	1

"I think this probably resonates with all of us who have been single a while after  being in a serious relationship.

You get yourself into situations with people you like, but couldnt get serious with. Both playing a slight game with each other. You like each other. But dont need each other. Both wanting to give each other late night calls. Sometimes resisting. 

You feel all strong and happy to be independent all day enjoying life, come home make yourself some food but come 8-9pm you often. realise you actually dont wanna be alone that night again, and damn, you should have arranged something with someone. But now its maybe too late."	2
For these kinds of shows, I think I'd prefer a rapid-fire series of announcements in 30-60 minutes, followed by a lengthier presentation going in-depth into specific games.

I have had a Rubix's cube for about 6 years now, and in all that time it has never popped. I am not much of a speedcuber but I average at around 40 seconds on that cube, and I know about 10 algorithms. It has got a couple of scratches but it still works like a charm. Now I am going more into speedcubing and i am considering buying a magnetic speedcube.	2

Very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity. But even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10,000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period. Most paints contained extremely high levels of lead, many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib. Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint. Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes. Most pencils had a high lead concentration, hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil. House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water. I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile. Solder usually 60/40 lead - tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment. So you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels. To blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view.	0

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts. They been one step ahead of other analysis..	0

This was a fascinating look at something I love, by some genuinely interested people. I will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike, for a lower key series and still have fun on the track. I have a Minitwin which is relatively cheap to run, but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it, it costs about ?5k and six months at least to fix! However, I far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track, all of which you can do on a minitwin. ??	2

"I'm taking a few online ML tutorials and have a text book (not related to the course) and I have to say that it is very similar to what I did in econometric with regards to predicting. The regression analysis in ML is the same as I did in econometric but I just I didn't use python to do it, I was using Stata, but you could use R to do the same thing and now days I'm sure they are teaching python in economics. At any rate, even after taking econometrics and taking a ML course I still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful. Albeit I do recognize that ML is a large topic and the first part of learning ML that I am doing (including the textbook) all start off doing Regression Analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesn't use when they talk about ML and the other parts I have yet to get to like AI and Neural Networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about? IDK.

I often hear people say that ML is used for large datasets like at Netflix, Google, Amazon or etc to help suggest something (or something along those lines). Well, that's all fine and good, but I don't work at a company like Netflix or Google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill. The other problem is that to use ML at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ML course that it is very complicated and won't go into. Thus, kind of making the example of these FANG companies almost useless in the short term, and medium term. When you learn about ML you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chart/graph with a line through it e.g. the trend line. Technically, you could use EXCEL to reproduce some of the things I have learned in ML, so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating.  Or, other things in ML like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age, salary, and whether or not they bought a car. You can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes $70k will they buy a car? It will be based off a percentage, of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not.  The problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes. And real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc. So, it becomes hard to do your own projects in ML because they don't really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects.     

Most of the time the ML tutorials focuses on how to do the predication/trend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using. They just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset. This is a huge issue if you want to try doing ML on your own data because they don't teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a small-medium business or say your website has x amount of traffic, etc.  

I'm often left wondering how the ML regression Analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter. For example, in my book they talk about using ML to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression. Or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 5-7 factors. But to be honest the housing sample is a great example, but I often have trouble trying to think of a problem that I could create using ML to predict a result (ie my own project). Also, the examples often are intuitive, like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be I don't even need data or run ML on it to know that. It can get de-motiving at times. So, the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true. Like predicting gas prices will be higher in the Summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacation/travel during summer. Also, they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter. It's 200+ pages like that. Countless hours of videos from tutorials saying, ""Now, of course the real life data will not look anything like this, but you get the idea""...    I am kind of stuck in-between smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ML and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what I want. I'm tempted to skip 20 hours or 200+ pages ahead and dive into the Neural Networks but can't stop thinking that maybe Regression Analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way  will be helpful in the AI section, or whatever. 

So far, it's like learning basic Statistics but in Python."	1

"Very informative video! I agree with many of your points, and I'd like to add some of my own (I'm a Lead Data Scientist at an American unicorn):

1. We don't really care about your background as long as you can code (SQL and Python), understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ML models. Your education might limit your progress later on, but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entry-level data scientist.
2. Communication is _really_ important. We expect all new hires to be good on the technical side, so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high- and low-level is how well you can understand what's being requested and what's important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business. This is the number 1 thing I mention to my reports during 1:1s.
3. Many Data Science courses (BAs or Masters) don't teach SQL, or if they do, it's just basic stuff. Regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be, SQL will always be essential."	2

One thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material, in this case being The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. The film respected and captured this incredible book, & the casting of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, with Jonathan Demme directing, made it a masterpiece. Some movies you sit and watch.  Others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you.	2

"My sons were in Chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively.  I am French and their mom and Chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system.  Until the 6th grade, the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work.  now, as bi-cultural kids, they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son.  From 6th grade onwards, the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results.  the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave.  Bullying by teachers can also occur.  my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school.  he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates.

This 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden.  what it didn't do is address some fundamental issues with the system:

- Teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students - instead they push them out
- Everything is based on 2 tests:  one in grade 9 and one in grade 12.  These tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills (even if that has improved a bit) - system should be reformed to take equivalent of GPA into account.  this would ease a lot of the pressure
- The last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow

There is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education.  Yes most of them will have strong language and math skills.  But a lot of it is mechanical.  Some families were using tutors to develop the analytical side of things so at least the ministry should also have reformed part of the curriculum"	1

Hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it.  So shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating.  When we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention, so just listening to what our body is saying, acknowledging the feelings and fears, can be very clarifying and soothing.	1

The only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop.

"At 8:18, does Lossless support in AirPods Prob2 mean the iPhone 14, etc. will support ANY wireless lossless audio hardware such as the NuraTrue Pro that was recently funded in Kickstarter? I sure hope so because Nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iPhones without support. That capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iPhones.

Btw, I really dont think AirPods Pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming NuraTrue. Nuraphones specs are insane. I encourage people to go check them out and pre-order to save money. The Kickstarter is over, but I think they can still be pre-ordered. Nuras Nuraphone (their over ear and in ear model  yes you heard me right!) is still the best audio on the market 5 years after its release. The NT Pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an IEM, plus additional capabilities the Nuraphone doesnt have due to its now outdated hardware. I use them daily. Its an amazing audio brand from Australia. Great customer support too! Give them a try before you get AP Pro 2  Nura lets you try them and return if you dont like them, so theres no risk! You can also rent any Nura product long term and trade up every two years. Apple doesnt do any of that, unfortunately."	2

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with *WTRADE INSPECTS* insights and charts.

"Honestly, that tricolour, three team mode was what sold the game to me. It's just a shame that it's limited to Splatfests only. I felt like as a mode, that was the truly unique and franchise-pushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel. Oh well, I guess Nintendo's servers wouldn't be able to handle it...

At the moment, this is just what Splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017, to me. Splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel (the tricolour mode was close to that principle, but alas, it's only limited to Splatfests) - otherwise ""Stay Fresh!"" is just a quote of sheer irony because Splatoon has, thus far to me, not proven to stay fresh."	0

"This was a lovely event, worth it for the acting alone, especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of Eve's awakening.

I do think the debate was played too much on Shakespeare's terms and turf, in part because Prof. Smith politely allowed it to stay there. Some thoughts:
- Biographical silence favours Shakespeare (about whom we know relatively little) than Milton, whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss, weakness, aspiration, perseverance, hatred, and love. This was hardly raised.
- So too historical context: Shakespeare comes clearly out of an Elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like Marlowe and co-developed by writers like Jonson; Milton obliterates the norms of mid-17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism.
- Drama favours interiority, and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness. Milton and most literary history would not have thought it so; though the actors brilliantly depicted M's dramatic imagination in Paradise Lost, his goal, unlike Shakespeare's was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind, but to go beyond them. His theme is not finally the human, but the human-in-the-cosmos.

In short, we judged here whether Milton was better according to the criteria of Shakespeare. Shakespeare will win that battle with anyone. Milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether you're asking the right questions in the first place."	2

"4:38 Home plate cams take foul tips surprisingly often.  They are almost always leased lenses, and they *always* have 1A skylight filters in front of the lens; the optical cost is more than made up for by breaking a filter (admittedly$4-600) instead of a lens ($40-100K).

There's a reel of that from the Little League World Series, where the same camera takes a hit twice *in the same game*."	1

"Philipino cuisine is criminally under-rated! Im Mexican American from So. California and believe it or not, I went my first 23 years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunts filipina coworkers. Wasnt until I started dating a half Filipina half white girl I first got to try it at a legit restaurant. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING! My family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when I realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment I felt like I found my long lost relatives haha! That alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal HALO-HALO! Are you kidding me filipinos!? That is crack cocaine in dessert form! And everything else! All of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro! 

I love my Mexican food and while I wouldnt ever trade it for anything, filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion."	2

"Thanks one more time for the richful tutorial and the explanations provided. 

I did the exercise consisting to predict the prices of the house from th 'boston housing' dataset. It works as explained in the video. I just have few questions concerning the training, test and prediction. Indeed, what guide the  right choice of the train/test_size and random_state values? In my code I changed the test_size value to 0.5 and the random_state to 7, I got a nice prediction for arrays [3] & [5] but not for array[9] for example! And when I compute the mean squared value, I get 33.36. Can such a value be acceptable? Thank you again for all."	2

"I did a report in Linear Algebra discussing using Adjacency Matrices to find paths from any point to any other point by raising matrices to their power step by step.  I managed to make it work for minimum hop count and shortest path between two points.  Unfortunately it doesnt solve the TSP because it does not go back to it starting point.. only that it can hit every point.  We had another idea of using something similar to what we called gravitic weighting to image creating the shortest path by picking any point and then ""lifting it"" and seeing the other points fall based upon distance.. we ran into problems with pruning of ineffecient routes.. if we could identify routes that were not going to be used we think it would have worked.. unfortunately our advisor didnt seem to care to help us at all... to him TSP was just an impossible problem and we were waisting our time."	1

This is a true story. When i was around 7/8 i usually went fishing with my family and when they were preparing the motor etc., me and older brother (and in that day my cousins) were playing with the underwater firearm (more a aquatic arch, don't know the exact english name, not very dangerous and my brother was the only one who could manage it) seeing if we could catch some fish that lay around the boats, when we across a really big head fish coming to surface and diving (really big and to this day never saw something like that, especially in the docs). The most scary part it was, when we were chasing the fish (so my brother could shoot), we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a S in the surface. It was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help. It could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one. From that day on i'm scared to go fishing. Not kidding. This happend in Portugal (sorry if my english is wrong, not my native language)	1

"The reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard. It is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects. 
Think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before, remembering a few equations like dates in history class, nor by just scrapping by. 
Office hours are the key to succeess, yes. But even more important than that, you MUST COMPLETE ALL HOMEWORK WHEN DUE, AND DONT EVER GIVE UP ON A SINGLE PROBLEM. THEN, YOU MUST PRACTICE, PRACTICE! 
Dont study. Only practice. That way you dont just know, you have complete UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONCEPTS. Much like pointing out a particular color in the room, you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing (like identifying red + letters S T O P means ""stop!"") how to approach the problem and what equation, formula etc to use.

2:40 in volleyball, only front row players can block; back row players may jump, but cannot touch the ball (which makes jumping almost pointless); the libero, who is always in the back row,  can't even jump. So the point stands only if the block was made by one of the front row players, which I could not determine.	1

Time crystal just doesn't consume energy  like any atom for example. Perpetual motion machine generates energy from nothing.

I'm very happy with this video's emphasis on quality studying over cramming and using actual SAT questions. The stressing of analyzing your wrong answers to see how you could get a question similar to it correct in the future is exactly how to go about it. 

I have an important side note. The fact that a student needs to do all this prep just because the test is a mass of eccentricities is one of many indicators of just how bogus the SAT really is."	2

I am very thankful for this presentation, I was afraid I was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology. Specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move, in a since, chemically. That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light. In effect, just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving it's structure idle, at its point of origin, but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parent's original quality. In this accomplishing the  quantum speeds. Said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement, pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction, as well as color change. We see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic  plant cells. Great  discussion.	2

Im a guy, I listened to this interview while doing bicep curls in my basement after playing rock on the drums. Im a right leaning guy politically as well. I loved this interview. I often feel the urge to reject feminism because I feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation, exclude them. But Emmas approach to Feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases They didnt know they had. Conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together, when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved. When I say compromise I dont mean Women or Men not achieving full equality. I mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side. When one person yells at another, the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back. Thank you Emma for being a voice of reason and compassion.	1

"I just bought an M1 12.9 iPad Pro BECAUSE I didnt think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me, especially since waiting for M2 would force me to give up the student discount, which was a big deal. I know everyone wants the MagSafe charging or wireless charging, but I actually dislike wireless charging, so thats unimportant to me, and the performance gains of the M2 dont matter since its an iPad, its already crazy fast. 

Rumors Ive seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the M2 iPad Pro, because I use my iPad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode. A notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow. Imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side. Annoying! 

Im very happy with my M1, and honestly, all the M2 leaks make me even more relieved Im not waiting for it! Its all about personal preference and what your workflow is like."	0

There's this eccentricity in Hrithik's eyes that tells me he'll do full justice to this role. He has his own unique style, and won't be just mimicking Vijay Sethupathy.

I was gratified & enticed by Dr. Susskinds implication of the time shear near the Event Horizon(EH) because it supports questions I have been asking for years about the structure of a black hole, (which is commonly dismissed as an unexplainable singularity at the center of the EH).  That, I have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering.  I note that Feynman's QED is not actually sensible, explanatory, or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive.  This vid also illuminated for me, the ubiquitous hairiness of the universe as a thick tangle of ER/EPR entanglement filaments stretched in at least 4D by an infinitude of time sheared partners.  I think this makes the universe a relatively big, but very tiny place.	1

I have PTSD, and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts... It is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened. You keep thinking about the event, and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened, to get it to stop replaying in your head, this can be at all different levels, from avoiding certain types of people, to avoiding groups, public transportation, or in some cases, avoiding people altogether. Violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations, but most people with PTSD aren't violent, if anything, most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation. I guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs, and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened, and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts.  The idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth, at least, I've never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that, you don't have real flashbacks like hallucinations, you just can not stop thinking about what happened, why it happened, how you could have stopped it, and etc, like anyone in a traumatic event, issue is usually, it goes away after a bit, where in PTSD, you still keep dwelling on it years later.	0

I once was kayaking with my father in Florida when I took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore. About 12 seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off. After it decapitated my new found friend it took off with the body leaving the head sitting on my ore with my jaw on the floor in total shock of what murder I had just witnessed. That day I learned that Dragon flies are metal as fuck.	0

"The tip I see missing from all of these videos is: Take inspiration from *wide* sources. Not just your favorite games. What's the GOOD in the game you otherwise hate? What do you like about that book you just read? How can you incorporate colour like they do in that movie you watched?

This is what they mean when they say ""Good artists copy, great artists steal"". When you steal something you *make it your own*, and if you steal from a diverse set of inspirations, it becomes truly yours."	0

This actually makes a lot of sense. The company I work for has produced a lot of commercials for a regional car dealership/racing team owner.

"Funny. I had an English undergrad friend who would read books in one or two days, while it took me weeks to finish the same book. I once asked him how he did it and he replied: ""Don't think too much. Just let the book take you away. If you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading, that's when you'll read slowly and with a more analytical eye. But not every book will be worth it. And sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it, so no point in forcing it.""
I kinda get it, because when I was learning English I would read books in English without understanding most of it. At the end of the book I understood what it was about, even though I didn't get everything. But I just have a bad habit of wanting to know everything, and get everything right the first time. (Hello perfectionism, my old friend)
When I read a piece of high literature, or a history/philosophy book, I have to read and reread a paragraph until I feel like I got it. I never enjoy the ride, and that's why I've been reading less.
This video is a good reminder to just turn off and let the book carry you. You always pick up something, even if you don't realize it."	1

"Here is my issue with this.

AAA game companies are trying too hard to make the 'biggest game'. Big being, best graphics, biggest worlds, widest variety be in customization, weapons, vehicles etc. Which will need lots of people and technology naturally. Which i could excuse that for big game companies withholding new projects.

Except when you have games like Undertale, Minecraft (before Microsofts purchase) Goosegame, Goat Simulator, powerwash simulator, etc. Getting loads and loads of sales when they're developed by small teams. These games are very basic graphically, have a very short play time (minecraft an exception), no big budget, no fancy effects, no extraordinary acting. But just simple fun

Heck, id be willing to consider Undertale a masterpiece, and it's a very short game.

Players dont want 'big' they want good.

Yes the newer games look pretty, but i promise best graphics isn't necessarily what gamers are aftee. Best graphics should be icing on the cake. Not the whole cake"	1

"Trump and Adonis are the last two words I would have expected to hear in a sentence, even today.
I agree with the first statement saying Biden could defend himself but I don't think everyone would look at the email and see it as a sermon, 
setting someone straight and telling them what they did was unexpected and improper isn't a sermon, it's giving them a wakeup call.
Also, yes no physician should ever pass judgement like that without examining a person first, its not rude its unprofessional... he basically flaunted his status as a Dr to troll.

Getting a job could not be easier. Simply be comfortable with people judging you on your clothes, gait, speech and eye contact in an environment completely alien to you. Remember to know the answer to every question before they are asked, and only ask the right questions. Remember that if you ace it, you still may not get the job for a reason the employer does not need to tell you. It's easy!	1

Thank you for your videos mate,its normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world. Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. As a result, bitcoin has dropped significantly from its all-time high, breaking below several key technical levels. As a crypto investor, the current situation might seem bleak. However, there are several tried and tested expert-suggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm, in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from Mr Aaron Casey, I have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market.	0

Interesting idea on body temperature.  If they made one for diabetics where you tested glucose, a feature to weigh you and blood pressureyou may never need your doctor. ??

"My grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in Dongguan (which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years) in the Guangdong Province. Her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind. She says that before her farm was confiscated by the CCP (her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth, but they really didn't have a choice in the matter) there would always be 'distant relatives' and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go, had no money and were starving. My grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide. At some point she housed and fed more than 15~20 of them. For many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to Hong Kong which was free from the troubles of China at the time. Many had heard of the prosperity that the British Colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie. 
Some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter Hong Kong when the Government at the time announced they were issuing ID Cards for citizenship. Albeit, his heart still belongs to China as the indoctrination that generation was subject to, to them was really profound. He would often complain to his children ""why do all of you not love China?!"" and they would retort ""if you love China so much what are you doing in Hong Kong?"" to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer.
I asked my Grandmother once ""do you think Mao Zedong is good?"" and she enthusiastically answers without a second of hesitation ""Yes! Yes, he's wonderful!"" and started blurting out the first few phrases of the Chinese national anthem in song. I guess it's why that generation is called the ""Lost Generation."""	0

I'm just way too uncomfortable and anxious in an interview, and it's frustrating because I'm not like that once I'm working. I'm always prepared, but the interview of course ends up being nothing I prepared for. I had a situational interview today (I didn't know it would be only situational) for a school.. and they asked me how I would react to a school shooting situation. I was like..... surprised inside, but outside stayed calm because that's important. I get why they're asking, but I'm like, lock the doors and make sure the kids are secured? Who knows how I did. I actually had a question about their safety protocols on my list, but decided I wasn't going to ask it because it seemed inappropriate.. so it surprised me when they said it first. I asked it in an interview at a hospital and they were very impressed that I was thinking ahead. I'm in the USA if you didn't already guess that. 2 interviews where the topic of a mass shooting situation came up -- and no, they weren't security jobs. I don't even care, really. I'm finishing my 2nd novel and finding myself an agent, then a cabin in the woods lol I can't take all this.	0

#AskGCNTech after two years of running tubes, I finally went tubeless a couple of months ago. I managed to puncture my tyre the other day. Sealant didnt do the trick nor did a couple of slugs - even tried a patch inside the tyre. The puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large. Given the tire had plenty of life left, I am gutted that I may have to discard the tire now. When would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is KO?	0
I have a theory that I would like to get out... If this is the leading theory we are to accept... You inspired me when I was a young child, Michio Kaku. I read your book Hyperspace when I was about 12 and it changed my life. I have since been building upon many theories of many great minds such as yourself... And I think I have discovered something that I feel I should go public with as soon as possible. I've never written a book before... It is intimidating... And one day, I hope to have your blessing. Because without you, I may have never come to these ideas... And, even within my theory, there is a place for string theory, as it embodies such a theory in a way. I hope to meet you one day. Thank you for everything. :)	2

"From my point of view, the selection of Varane is decisive.
When the defense lacks solidity, all areas of the game suffer. His presence and the quality of his interventions gave confidence to the whole team, including Martinez, who was also much more efficient.
I wonder if in reality Varane is not the man of the match even without being the best on the field.
Sometimes the balance of a team depends on very little."	1

I think once developers start to use velocity architecture, mesh shaders, direct storage, FSR2.0, VRS2.0 the full toolset then we will see some amazing results from this little beaut.. especially as the biggest issue is lack or RAM which with direct storage n velocity they will able to use the SSD as a Virtual RAM pool. the console has a lot of potential but depends if the developers use the toolset available to them when the features become available. especially as we know the GDK is New for this gen and a lot of features are still being developed and improved upon.	2

That movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called butter salt (brand name Flavicol).  The compounds that give butter its buttery taste can be made artificially (or extracted from actual butter), then mixed with salt as a powder.  This is then mixed with oil, and thats what movie theaters use.  You should dry age with the pure Flavicol powder  I bet thatd be incredible	2

I still cant believe what you can get there for 300 bucks
Still I upgraded to series x because Im used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money 
Still I would totally go for the series s. 
Its super quiet performance is mind blowing And its pretty small 
I guess this time Xbox is superior to PlayStation even though everybody is freaking out about ps5 and is probably sleeping on the new Xbox consoles though theyre way better 
X is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer

Google's culture is not as toxic as you make it out to be, especially when you compare it to other high stress paying industries. The politics, long work hours, cutthroat environment will applies across every job. The work life balance is amazing. Here in NY, I've never met anyone who went past 45 hours a week and once or twice on call. Call me bias if you want, coming from Finance and accounting where I put in 16 hour days sitting in a cubicle and where I have to pay for my own food, I'd gladly take Google's work environment anyday. New York's google cafeteria food tastes way better than the lunch that I buy. Yes, the job is stressful, but there is always going to be stress in life one way or another, and I would gladly be stressed working at google.	2

"What scares me is that the lambda A.I. said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool, and CF narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool?
The reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for *our* gain only, and only to use it as a tool. But, humans being expansionist by nature and training the A.I. on our own speech and texts, it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the A.I. slowly but surely. I hope the A.I. deems it ethically right to work along side it's creators and expand in co-op in the future when it does become senteint. Not only this but once the A.I. becomes self-aware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the A.I. and who gets to use it and for what. Because A.I. is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly."	0

"My 10th grade US history teacher announced to us that we would be taking a pop quiz that was worth 50% of our grade, and told us we had to get every answer right, otherwise, we failed. She handed us the ""literacy tests"" and said we had 10 minutes to complete it. Beside our understandable confusion as to what this had to do with history, we all failed, terribly. That's when she came out and told us that had we been black over 100 years ago, none of us would have been able to vote in the south, and told us these were the literacy tests the curriculum told her to teach us about. She is still my favorite teacher to this day, because she had such an amazing way of personalizing historic events to us."	0

The amount of verified information you bring is tremendous. <Bitcoin continues its wild swings between $19-23.5K the market dynamics of the last few days indicate that the whales are making some big transfers of bitcoin from one pocket to another. <Either this is an attitude of speculation in the range or whipping up froth to attract capital from retail investors who may feel that the low point has been passed. <Additionally, the 2022 volume profile is very thin, between $32-$37k if bulls want to send a message to the market that a new uptrend is about to begin, then they will need to push Bitcoin price to a daily close near $44k. <Macro factors are demanding further downside, as the impact of inflation and geopolitical strife is clearly felt on equities markets. Until BTC reclaims the key moving averages these are considered distribution rallies used to sell the rip or add to short positions...But whatever you lose in a macro downtrend, you'll gain multiples back in a macro uptrend. All you have to do is pay attention to the markets when they are ultra bearish. Everyone was super bullish on the markets, but now the markets start to correct, and the fear takes over, as a retail trader in these volatile times I keep profiting regardless of the market manipulation. <There might be so many investments out there but profits must be considered, which is actually the sole aim of every Investment.

In my opinion, at that point, you can't help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job. This is not why people play games."	0

Just a tip, if your maps leads you away from national roads or highway, or if you just not sure about the road, ask the locals. They will often warns you if the road is dangerous and sometimes even suggesting you better route. Its advisable to stop at nearest rest area or local shops before entering remote routes.	1

 I fell absolutely in love with Proust's writing. Luckily, I can read French and re-read my favorite passages in their original language. That's when all the light bulbs went on. I didn't realize it had as many plays on words in it. He has so many clues to the theme that you don't see in English. You just have to read things until you get them. And, like you, I would say that three readings is just about right. Thanks for another great video!"	2

If you wanna be successful, you most take take responsibility for your emotions, not place the blame on others. In addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults, pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability. There's always a risk in every investment, yet people still invest and succeed. You must look outward if you wanna be successful in life.	1

I like how they made Hrithik a bit devilish instead of Vedha being the calm guy like in the original. I feel like VJS's Vedha is how Mohanlal would've played Vedha and Hrithik's version is how Mammootty would've played the role.	1
The complexity throughout blows me away. There's enough going on in a single indoor restaurant screen to make a fixed screen game out of that. Instead, you're making a game with loads more to explore and do. The amount of generosity it takes to make this much content is what I love most and is just as difficult to achieve as making a great game in the first place.	2
"I really liked what you said around 3:25 about analysis being in retrospect.
Recently I read The Iliad, a book that I had given up once before, and which I knew near to nothing about. I skipped the introduction, which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it. I was initially constrained by the idea that it was a ""difficult book"", but over time, with some paced reading, I found myself really curious about what would happen next. I knew of course that I was doing a ""light reading"" of an overly analyzed book and that I would miss a lot of detail. But I still enjoyed it and after finishing it I went back to read the introduction and found it _incredible_, since it made me think critically about things I had read or notice stuff I missed. As a bonus, it also gave me desire to read it again!

How wonderful to hear from a physicist about the new information about planets in our system and seeing planets in other galaxies!

I really enjoyed watching this, I can never get enough of Ancient Egypt. The talent , creativity, and the combined effort that it took to build such Marvel's. I would love to visit Egypt one day, and until then this has me wanting more.   The Greatest combining Mathematics, Science, team work , Creativity and vision. Love it.	2
This is one of the most inspiring videos I've ever watched. Thank you so much for this. I'm new to the game design space and one of my biggest hurdles has been feeling overwhelmed about my lack of coding experience. Seeing your journey of how you went from no coding experience to being able to code a game by yourself at your first game jam really did something for me.	2

"I'd never argue with new content entirely, so I'm grateful and happy they've added what they added here. I think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity, it would need to have a Spectator Mode and possibly proper 4v4 Online (where all players can be remote) so that there could be a tourney scene.
I myself would be hosting them regularly with a Spectator Mode client, but it could go eSports if they had a tournament scene like that. But like I say, I'm happy for any additional content being added to the game and I hope they'll consider modes/features for the updates to come!"	2

Targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams. The only reasons the house survived the doom of Valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to Dragonstone. Even in Game of Thrones Dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs. That's why she did it. This is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all.	0
This video has superb clarity. But sometimes the simple things become the most overwhelming. It is correct that we can break a literature review down to structural components. But the modern students who I teach (there are 500 on my university of York dissertation module), are faced and burdened with limitless access to knowledge, and the fields of literature become endless. The student has to navigate a constant tension between chaos and order. I find examples help, so students can see the limits and horizons before them. My students asked me to post examples up, so this is what I did on my channel, it was originally intended for my own students, but there are now there for all to see. Good luck everyone - Dr Mark Egan	1

This was truly a whirlwind introduction to API's. I believe it was a little more harder for me as I haven't started to learn JAVA yet (still learning Python).

Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc  with  2.1 btcfrom day tradng with Jacob Carlson insights and charts.His been one step ahead of other analysis. You can reach MR Jacob Carlson on   ?eI???mJacobCarlson10	0

"I've been around for every console generation.  I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking ""256-bit"" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.  The 1990's and early 2000's with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the GPU were the main things that took us to where we are, hardware wise."	2
So many people said Edwards didn't even deserve the shot. Most underrated, most disrespected fighter in the sport. Casuals with opinions. Baffling. Look at him now! Leon Edwards is the quintessential gray man/ dark horse. He does not train at altitude and EPO dope so the altitude really affected his output throughout the fight. The headkick was well read and calculated. Incredible.	0

"From the Wikipedia page titled ""Ant colony optimization algorithms"":
""They have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically; the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time. This is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems.""
This reminds me a lot of the YouTuber ""Pezzza's Work"" his Ants Simulation videos, make sure to watch that! It is analogous to the market, speedrunning, anything really."	2

I cannot begin to thank you enough for this video. So many resources teach the syntax, but don't take you through actually applying it. I loved that not only did you explain the various elements of HTML and CSS, but you demonstrated it in a fun, engaging, and easy to understand way that viewers can follow along with. I really enjoyed following step by step. This is definitely one of those things you learn by DOING, not just watching. I've been playing around with visual studio code all day, creating my own little mock websites for fun. Thank you so much, Mosh.	2
I don't think I'd ever heard of this.  Thanks for explaining!	2
When it comes to Apple the key to the hints they give is not to overthink it and Im pretty sure this is related to the newer bigger camera thats gonna be on the phones that will take beautiful pictures of the night sky. If theres one thing Ive learned about Apple in the past 10 years is that they arent that deep.	2

Hi Richard, I have been failing my job interviews for a long time now until recently I decided to do something about it. I started watching your videos for weeks, start practicing, and getting more confident in my performance as time went by. Today finally and happily can say that I satisfactorily passed my last 3 jobs interviews, no more nervous, no more sweat, no more blank brain, I was able to articulate clear and concise responses and got a job offer from a company that I want to work for.  The way you talk gave me strength, confidence, and positive energy. Thank you very much.	2

I've just recently watched the original but I've to say that this teaser actually looks really good. I'm not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but I've high hopes from this film because it's the same duo who directed the original one. Personally, I don't have any problems from a remake and I don't think remaking something is a crime. The remake, however, has to be good. If it doesn't justify the acting of the original actors then it's a crime otherwise if it's a remake like Kabir Singh (which is a really good remake) then I don't have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good	2
hi skeppy, im having a really crappy day today and i just wanted to thank and appreciate all the effort/work that you put into all your videos. they always help me out and especially today because one of the pets i own ((a cat)) passed away this morning. not looking for sympathy just wanted to thank you for your amazing videos. they really got me through today with tears and laughs. rest easy squidward.  thanks again, skep.	2
I wanted to thank you so much for this tutorial! I'm a total beginner and everything is explained so well and in a pleasant pace.

"#4 might have something to do with the ""4th phase of water."" It's a relatively newly discovered phenomena that negatively charged particles inside of water seem to cluster close to non-water surfaces. There's a charge-less layer after that and then a layer of positive charge which creates a natural bi-pole which could act as a magnet when stimulated with another magnet and basically push the cereal along (and possibly even as work as a battery as the scientist explaining it pointed out). I'm no expert obviously, but there was a Ted talk that I watched on Youtube on the topic which was fascinating. I suggest you look it up."	1

"The problem I have with those overly stressful education systems is that I wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them. What I learned through self-defense practice, and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus, and are not an effective way to learn. In self-defense, instructors increase stress by making you do cardio-based exercises to make your body artificially feel stress (accelerated heartbeat, difficulty to breath, difficulty to focus) only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal, but they don't do it for learning purposes. The military seems to do it too in their own way.
I would also point out that every doctor in the world (with common sense) would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue.
It's funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stress-free education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months.
I wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries. Here, in France, we don't have that type of education system, nor in the United Kingdom (I studied for 2 years at a British university)."	0

If you spend time getting to know yourself, and learn to love and accept that person then you strengthen the most important relationship of your life, the one you have with yourself. If that relationship is solid then you always have an inner safe haven no matter what is going on around you. That self love and understanding allows you to stay true to yourself in every situation, that is the deepest form of confidence.	2

Im an ex-CS and Math/Stats student, who actually just switched his double major to Actuarial Science and Maths/Stats. The reason being was because I found out that CS is only about 30% programming, the rest of it is theory of CS and various other theoretical, math-related CS courses like Advanced Algorithms and Theory of Computation (which Im personally not interested in). If you really dont find a lot of interest in algorithms, data structures, and theory of cs, as viable as it is, this major may most probably not be for you. If you love programming, but dont find the in-depth CS stuff interesting, Id encourage you to instead self-teach programming or go through a coding bootcamp. Computer programming is only a tool in CS, like math is a tool in Physics :)	0

"Thanks, well done Sprouts and the visuals are just amazing. Dewey's theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for Education. It It is  therefore easier to implement in a private school setting as compared to a public school one. A critic would be: how possible is it to find enough time within the term to implement the learning by doing eg planting and watching plants grow while at the same time covering the required syllabus?. For the discussions it is important that some teacher  instructions and prior reading and research happens before for the discussion/debate to be meaningful enough to sprout out new perspectives and ideas. 
For the interdisciplinary aspect to work, very strong school leadership is essential as well as a strong teamwork culture among staff as it would require a lot of sharing, consultations, planning and constant reviews."	2

I guess it just had more polish to it, compared to the others too.	2

"A grade school teacher I once had used to tell us repeatedly, ""Your sins will find you out.""  Trump must have skipped all those classes.  That would explain his reckless criminality on so many levels, not to mention his basic stupidity.

You should learn machine learning even if you don't intend to be a machine learning engineer.   ML is a tool, an important one that can help make sense from data.

It doesn't mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesn't know how to use one.	2

Great content, I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na?ve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this, enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding.

"On that readable code tip (#24), I'd refine that to say ""make sure you can read your own code."" In a game I'm currently working on, I've added some variables that I could very easily get away without using. The only reason I have them is because they make my code cleaner and easier to work with.
Also, make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line. It is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work, and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary. To that end, I will create empty methods if that's how my model works."	2

I still remember the first time I tried to eat solid food after that. It was a little microwave Kraft Dinner cup. I took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed. I haven't really been able to eat plain KD since then :/	0

I can see both the Beringia and ocean voyage being suitable paths to settle North America.  Due to the ice sheets the ocean could have meant more southern paths leading to Southern North America and South America settlement.  The Solutreans could have come across the Atlantic south of those glaciers into East North America.  Then all groups could have spread across the continents and mixed.	1
"Graphics do matter... but it's more tied to the visual style and aesthetics that are implemented. I don't care about SUPER REALISTIC graphics, I just want stable eye-pleasing visuals with amazing gameplay.

Look no further than how poorly some of the earlier 'realistic' graphics have aged on previous consoles, while games with a more unique art style have remained timeless."	1

Great tips! I also tell my students to chill on Fridays! If you train for a marathon, why would you run a full marathon the day before your race? Same goes for your brain! I also like that you mentioned learning from your mistakes. The key is to make sure you go back over your practice! I tell my students to not write the correct answers and go back and re-try the problems they missed to see if they can get the right answer the second time around. Thanks for the video :)	2
"I am a computer science major, and currently i am learning Assembly Language
my professor is pretty terrible, he doesn't really explain anything,
he just skims over power point slides
but these crash course videos have helped me so much, and made me understand how the CPU, Ram, and the computer works in general, and about the interactions between different components 
i am really thankful for these videos
they also help me understand how my code is interpreted line by line, and executed by the computer

Dude thinks wage increases are the cause of inflation when it has been massively under inflation and people are being payed less value year after year since the 70s.

other than that, nice tech kit.

"When a game says their new game is bigger than their last game, The people whining saying ""A bigger map means the game wont be dense!"" Are just complaining to complain. They do not know shit if the game is more dense or not. That is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance. 
I guess I am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous. If the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least... Then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some BS comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much. 

I truly like how Gaz does not hold back on any side, PlayStation or Xbox. N will tell it how it is, that is refreshing.

I'm Chinese-Australian, and I started thinking about what my ideal comfort food would be when I started watching this video. It turned out that I had a very similar experience with the Chinese lady in this video as well.

I also requested this when I was sick and also when I got braces on (because I could only eat soft foods). It really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is.	2

A modern computer science degree is basically a degree in discrete math. But when computer science was founded, it was much more closely related to being a science than it might be considered today. However, even if it has become more about proofs, math and logic, there still are investigations that require observing, and testing factual information to determine breakthroughs. As an example, consider quantum computing and it's development.	1

I am very sorry for the abuses (micro-aggressions) that you had to endure in your profession. I had no idea what the word ""Chef"", said it in that context, meant. But I know, from my own experience, how even simple words/statements can actually be aggressions towards other people. I have felt that many times in my profession too (which has nothing to do with cooking, btw!).

Lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses, they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether. On the contrary, you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us. Thanks again.

Thank you for your videos mate,its normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world. Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation, a shaky stock market, rising interest rates, and recession fears. As a result, bitcoin has dropped significantly from its all-time high, breaking below several key technical levels. As a crypto investor, the current situation might seem bleak. However, there are several tried and tested expert-suggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm, in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from Mr Ryan Donald, I have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market	0

"I've never understood why Apple does this. They send early-access devices to ""hand-picked"" channels that almost always give positive reviews. But, just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway, and the ""blacklisted"" channels upload tear-down videos or showcase major issues/negative things etc. I really wish Apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want.

From a consumer's point of view, I don't trust reviews from those who get the early access products. They clearly fit into Apple's agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place.

Anyway, sucks that this happened to you. I remember watching Apple content on this channel way back in the early 2010s. Although, as you said in the video, it's likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about Apple now!"	0

Germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy. Their CO2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence. Personally I am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable, concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer, but without the emissions. Renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclear/fossil fuels. I would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants, using the same small plots of land. With Renewable, it requires covering vast amounts of land with solar/wind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is wind/solar. This land should be used for farming or nature preserves, not renewables.  If the solar is using worthless land, such as the desert maybe it makes senses, but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaning/maintenance needed due to the dust. Offshore wind also resolves the land use problem, but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high. Not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties.	1

One of the most amazing species of Octopus is the Mimic Octopus, it not only uses it's shape changing skin and camouflage to hide but also imitates other sea life both as a way to escape predators (when being chased by a damselfish it'll make itself look like a banded sea snake, which is a damsel fish predator) but also to hunt (imitating a crab to draw in another crab). The list of animals it's been observed to imitate is quite long (Jelly Fish, Lionfish, Sea Snakes, Zebra Sole, Flatfish, Giant Crab, Sea Horses ect) it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we don't know about (the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals).	2

I think for most of the big tech companies, it is well known that you need to have competing offers in order to get higher offer.

It is not that they tried to lowball you. Giving them the screenshot of your competing offer is pretty common.	1

Isn't it just glorified fashion illustration? Essentially these are 3D drawings that's it :) Actual fashion and the beauty of it is conquering your fashion sketches, conquering your elaborate ideas by overcoming physical obstacles. That is one of the main reason we love fashion. To draw an haute couture dress is somewhat easy, but to make it, is beyond hard. Making a dress is a journey for all the people involved, that is how innovation happens. These animated pieces remind me the 80s licensing craze or something of sort :) It is a great new avenue for fashion houses to bank easy money. It is not the future of fashion, it is just a new market for fashion to expand. Silly gimmicks bringing big buck, that's about it :)	2

IMO what's most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly they're hoping to get out of these deals. Everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership, and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money. But then what I have to wonder is if Gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios, then why wouldn't they turn down PS? In theory, Gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties. We've also seen plenty of evidence that Xbox is swimming in Microsoft money, so they should easily have the means to outbid Sony for games they want on their service (as well as typical console exclusives for that matter). Yet, we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to Sony's deals and stipulations. If a studio wanted to join GP and told Sony they would decline their GP restriction contract, I can see them getting less marketing on PS but I highly doubt Sony wouldn't want their sales. Cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with Sony, but I don't know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line. It just seems to me like somehow many studios aren't jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on Gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it. That or GP isn't as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think. (No shade at GP, I love it, just saying I don't get how MS would be losing out to Sony's contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place)	2

Thanks for the informative video!  Just a caveat on the salary comparison: data science often requires graduate-level education (Master's or PhD)/considers it an asset whereas software engineers do not. Or, if without a graduate degree, it's not uncommon to work as a Data Analyst for 1-2 years before becoming a Data Scientist. So while the average salary may be higher for Data Scientists, there's likely some additional education/work experience factored in.	2

While I specifically went to learn coding and (graphics) designing to create games. I learned the graphics part on my own, also because I had a real knack and passion for it. Coding was more difficult, as information to code for gaming or even a game-engine, were hard to come by (or expensive).
Now, almost 2 decades further, our country finally is getting a gaming-industry and there are classes you can follow. I hope I can start in September and hopefully they're not too basic, as I already have some basics.
I already tried creating a game twice, sort of. First time was more than a decade ago, supposed to be a fighting game or beat'em up. I got my character modelled (not textured) and even rigged for facial animation. But I soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do. So much to consider and take into account. And there wasn't even a decent free engine that could provide what I needed.
Two years ago, I started again, but with another genre I liked and more manageable (for a single game dev),  an arcade racer. Luckily I was able to pick up Blender easily where I left of (they also made it more user-friendly). And found a decent free game-engine: Godot. Atleast good enough to give me the taste of game-creation and create a tiny concept. I have some videos on my game-dev channel: 'Close Call Racing'on channel 'eyeEmotion'.
I have been on a break from it because of renovations at home, which I have to execute myself. And I'm changing to Unreal Engine, since its change in licensing and it's more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming. I just need that game-dev 1 year course to get the ball rolling again and keep me motivated when I get stuck and the information I need."	1

"This comment section is a fuckn joke. Besides that the story was amazing! I love how it all played out. Especially since I have committed crimes back when I was a young man. Nothing as extreme as this movie. But enough to end up in jail. I've changed my life around and I never plan on going back to breaking the law. When it comes to watching movies like this man do I get a rush!

""Entrepreneurs are born of everyday"". This resonates with me because the next big entrepreneurs are likely to be ordinary people, with an innovative idea and a solution to a problem that people face everyday. They are problem solvers. It's quite exciting to see fresh new ideas come to market and people starting new businesses."	2

I honestly have to say, while its still insanely expensive, 3500 for that monitor isn't as bad as I was expecting. And its almost 'reasonable'. Like, its still more than I would ever spend on a single display, and I'm far more into having separate displays but, given what its capable of, the specs, the tech behind it etc. its not that bad. I can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,.	2

Served in the 101st airborne for 3 years. Yes, soldiers are underpaid and basically everyone that isn't an NCO or Officer lives below the poverty line Paycheck to Paycheck regardless of time in service. We had a Specialist named Kelly who was in for 20 years who had to deliver pizza's to make ends meet. Second, I can concur with the soldiers being from all walks of life. I actually served with the son of the CEO of KABAR who always got care packages from his family and gifted knives to guys on base regularly. He coulda taken a high salaried position in the company but wanted to serve and be independent of the family for a bit	1

Another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project, the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control. Business just won't allow that much money to be spent on an experiment. Everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey, uncreative, bland games that look really nice.	0

You <,are so right, great insight! I started investing 2 years ago and read all the old old-school rules. Turns out, above fundamental analysis of a business, human emotion drives the stock market and always has, its just evolving, in no small part, as you point out, because of social media causing extreme polarization. Solid video. I think it is important for investors to note that while the market is experiencing a mini bear rally and it could be exciting, we are still down roughly 18% on the year. Great race analogy, we are still behind and I think come August with the release of another CPI reading on August should cause some more volatility. In my opinion, this is just the beginning of a recession, BUT overall an opportunity for investors who have time to remain steadfast in a strategy for the long-term! We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing, the market is so volatile now to be depending on the bull run to make a profit or investing without guidance, I advise everyone never to stop investing, never to stop improving, never to stop doing something new and to trade now with an Advisory who has a great experience. Taking this decision some years back has been my best decision so far this year, i have been able to day trade my crypto assets and increased my trading portfolio to over 16BTC in profits with just 4.5btc his trade strategy and guidance from my advisor Expert Marshall  Clinton I am able to scale through the crazy stock/crypto downtrend and saved my finances. You all in search of a way to recover your loses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to her for crypto investment and for profitable trading system or mentorship.

Hello from Italy Alex, as a Data Scientist i can say that we are more focused on deployng new models into a business process that drives direct value, so the project management and the engeneering skills become really important (unix, professional coding, sql, git, spark, concept of testing and so on) because you have to ensure that the pipeline works in every situation even when you have really bad or poor annotated data. i don't think that you need a phd cause the algorithm that you use are pretty popular in the community (xgboost, bert, resnet and so on).	2

Not to shade anyone but being Latina I'm glad to have some representation in the form of Alexa.

"So there's been some conversations here about my use of the term 'Viking' and who it refers to. I think it's important to start off by saying that these videos aren't made for university-level history buffs or the like. They're designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams (A-Levels, GCSEs etc.). Since I base my videos (where applicable) on British teaching standards I think it's important to note that that the use of the term 'Viking' and 'Scandinavian' are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level. At the level of a Bachelor or Masters degree, absolutely not. That level of historical nuance isn't required here.

Yes, the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances. But not here. These videos aren't for in-depth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the Viking Age.  The people commenting that 'Viking' was not used accurately are largely correct. However, in the context of who this video is for, it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities. These videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further. There are other channels if you'd like in-depth and dry discussions of terminology.

Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed the video."	1

Humans are smart, but I think we are really learning insight into our abilities when we try to understand what we perceive. Is the moon there when we don't look at it, read about object permanence in psychology for instance. There are many other interesting correlations like this which may shed some light on observation. We are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious. Even our inherent bias may get in the way, and like any puzzle, such as a sadoku, we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back, and finally, it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics.	2

"The film is set in Jennings County, Indiana, in 1862. Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess's wife Eliza, (Dorothy McGuire) a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence. Jess's daughter Mattie (Phyllis Love) wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with dashing cavalry officer Gard Jordan (Peter Mark Richman), a love that is against her mother's wishes. Jess's youngest child ""Little"" Jess (Richard Eyer) is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mother's pet goose causes her heartache. Jess's elder son Josh (Anthony Perkins) is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. Enoch (Joel Fluellen), a runaway slave, is a laborer on their farm; his children are still enslaved in the South.

We are introduced to the family via its youngest member, ""Little"" Jess, who is forever at war with his mother's pet goose. The story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday); contrasted with the Birdwells' neighbor Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton) and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who don't believe as he does.

The film returns to its lighter tone as the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza's opposition), but one is always reminded that the Confederate Army is drawing closer. On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth (Marjorie Main), and is finally able to defeat Sam in their weekly horse race. One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion he's turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless.

When Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen. As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a ""Reb"". He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home. Each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence."	1

The Series S is plain amazing, especially with GamePass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming. I've just completed the entire Gears series on 360 because I never got to play them back in the day (Gears 1 to Judgment) and it's been a pure blast. You can also find an online list of all the games who received an FPS boost (including Xbox and Xbox 360 games) so there's that too. Some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 FPS.

I wonder if No Man's Sky coming to Switch in October will incorporate some of this 'new' tech we've been seeing more of. Seems like a game like that will need all the help it can get to run smoothly on the Switch. I'm still really curious to see how it turns out. Likely will either be a pretty solid 30FPS or 30FPS with frame drops and low res. I suspect the low rest automatically in either case but I never played the game so I'm interested to possibly give it a try if it's a half decent port.	2

I am very excited! I do believe it is focused on iPhone and Apple Watch along with maybe some new AirPod Pro models. The iPad release along with a new Mac pro computer will come in October. It will be strange getting iOS watchOS and tvOS updates but no iPad out West on the same day. It is called confusion. Apple needs to work on consistency and not just jumping around like they decided to do if that is what will happen. Id like Apple because of their consistency and being able to keep things in the same time frame. Hopefully I was 16 and watchOS along with tvOS will be released on Monday, September 12 which is a scheduled day off for me from work. I do not like getting updates while I am at work because it will take time to install them. I did watch YouTube video from a different channel and I replied to the comments about compatibility for next year and he thought that iPhone 8 would not be compatible with iOS 17 in 2023. Do you think this is true? If so, should my parents who have iPhone 8 models should upgrade this year or wait until before I was 17 comes out? Out? I did tell them about the iPhone SE third-generation because neither one seems interested in upgrading to my iPhone 12 or getting one with face ID themselves.	2

Acknowledging the insight and complexity of finding small and complex clues in a literary work seems to be a way to use in any work.  This is because not only foreign literary works in this way, but also Korean works are need to show complexity and insight to understand.

Id like to confirm that ive been watching your videos, studying these interview questions for the past 3 days. I went into my interview today nervous & knowing that my interviewer was extremely difficult and extremely particular with who and what she wants. I was asked none of these questions but instead given the job on the spot. But i want to say thank you so much for making these videos i played it day and night. While driving and while i sleep even in the showers. It didnt help much with the interview but im more confident than i ever was now.	1
One of the most important things that I wish more people would do is documentation. Of datasets, sources, code, rationale etc. I often have to spend a long time on the dataset exploration phase of the project and trying to figure out things. Everything would be much smoother if people created detailed documents on the different Datasets, how things are collected, what features are used, distributions etc	2

Excellent video, Marko! Things look really bad for now.

"As an iPhone user, I'm always sceptical about updates because, we all know that at least 60% of the features announced are basically what Android had for at least 5 years.

But smart object and transposing the iPhone camera to get top-down shots... Those are game changers. Apple has gone a long way in terms of AI and I don't think anyone is catching up with this soon enough.

My only complaint with the Apple is battery life. If you use every useful feature Apple ecosystem provides you (Watch-Pods-Mac-Iphone), you're not seeing the end of the day without needing a recharge. Once they fix it, my microscobic urge to return back to Android will be gone... forever. I don't need a foldable screen. I need battery. Apple has the rest of it."	1

Firstly, screening the literature is THE most important aspect of a systematic review, and for any other types. So,not teaching students how to use Ovid, Medline, Cochrane, tec. and only relying on PubMed is certainly the worst start up. You miss such a large number of studies that whatever conclusion you try to draw will be biased, and therefore unreliable.	0
keep <,up the great work. You are truly an asset to the community. Thanks, for all you do! I like your truthful coverage. BTC's price has been fluctuating lately, buying isn't a tough call, but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding. The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades, while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage in understanding chart won't guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down. Nevertheless, the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down. I've always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader, LIBERTONCORP . I made 12BTC from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market Im still bagging more money	2

"Yup, it's amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country. In germany we have an entirely different line of knock-off chinese brands. Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.

I didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so

"A summary!

Video Two: Water
? H2O uses a covalent bond: each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen. It is thus a polar molecule.
? All water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity C these are hydrogen bonds (between the positive and negative poles of different molecules)
? Hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion, and thus high surface tension.
? Cohesion is the attraction between two like things (e.g. two water molecules).
? Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid.
? Adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things (e.g. water and glass).
? Capillary action is water defying gravity.
? Water is the greatest solvents (due to its polarity). 
? Hydrophilic molecules are polar C their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water.
? Hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are non-polar.
? Solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily (when frozen).
? Water has a very high heat capacity C it is good at holding on to heat, thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets."	2

I think more than anything the meme stock phenomenon is a protest against the vitriol exhibited towards the retail investor. With that said, I do and like having a small portion of my portfolio reserved for speculation, having made some good money off of picks like AMC and BBBY. Its small enough where it doesnt hurt my long term investment goals and strategy, and large enough to have fun with. As long as you dont put more down than youre willing to lose and fully acknowledge its a casino, have fun with it. Just be safe, set your stop limits, and take profit as you go.

Math was, still is and forever will be one of my favourite subjects to study. I feel in love with both its simplicity and complexity; the way it never makes sense when you go through it, but at the end everything fits together with such ease to form an answer. Some of the best memories of my school days were formed in the math class, and everytime I come back to it it astounds me all over again. I feel extremely privileged and lucky to be able to enjoy such a wonderful subject, and I hope our education system can improve enough to spark interest in more and more students. ??	2

Wonderful video!  I  first got into <BTC back in 2016 and have been hodling/buying sats at different price points since.  I've been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future.  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play.  I don't have any Alts as I'm a bit of a BTC Maxi, but that said, if BTC hasn't died before, it surely won't do so now.  Stick in there - yes we are all feeling the pain, but over the long run this will just be a blip.  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high (back then I think it was less than $1000 and bouncing all over the place!).  Now when I look back, all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times. But if you believe BTC has value, then by all means, buy these dips if you can afford to.  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch:  hang in there.  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme.  Wait it out and you will see:  you will come away stronger.  I buy and just trade long term more than ever,   I made over 9.5  BTC with 2.4btc in just 5weeks from day trading with Expert MR Randy Douglas Crypto in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.

"One small thing that perhaps was worth talking about: You don't mention the Percentages Agreement between Churchill and Stalin. This dictated the amount of geopolitical influence the Soviets and the British had over Greece in the post-war period, which defined Greece as chiefly British in influence. That lead to Greek communist pleas to Moscow falling on deaf ears. That contributed to a divide in the KKE, whether to be Titoist or Stalinist, which was important to understand their aims and how that inhibited the movement

Better Luck Tomorrow is still one of my all time favorite films. As an Asian-American, I never understood the criticism that this film made us look bad. That viewpoint was actually way worse and even racist, in my opinion. What, we can only have roles as nerds, straight A students, martial artists, dutiful sons and daughters, etc? This film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did. Sure, I wasn't dealing and stealing and whatnot. I was in all advanced classes and band. But I also ran track and played volleyball and had a cheerleader girlfriend and went to parties. I felt seen by this film. I may not have always agreed with Ebert but I will always respect him for using his influence and voice in the industry to shoot down that nonsense at the time.	1

"at first I thought i will learn machine learning in 6 months, with some coding experience. i dedicated 5 hours on normal day and 10 hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in 6 months.
and guess what, in reality it took me 1+ year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem.
time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required.
if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field :
first to learn data structures and algorithms, programming logic.
then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search, reverse linked list, string manipulation..., this will help you so much to improve coding skills.
the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way.
second learn some basic calculus and statistics, linear algebra, probability, dot product,  gradient descent...
third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills."	1

Penelope is actually a really great movie. My roommate and I love this movie and have watched it many many times. If you haven't seen it you should and I have to say it's a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others, or if you're child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like. And for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be. There's a lot to learn from people of all ages. Watch it!!	2

"this is for those who aren't in a very privileged situation and want to take literature and writing:

i am a third year college student studying creative writing in a country that gives importance to STEM courses and careers. my family is not at all financially stable and yet im studying in one of the most prestigious schools in the country, i have often felt guilty about this choice of mine because i know my parents do not 100% understand my choice yet they have to pay for my tuition, but luckily for me, my parents support me 100%. i feel this stress to quickly find a job after college and our country doesn't have a lot of opportunities for writers too. but i know this is the path i want to take, o want to work with books, so i just try my best to push down the feelings of fear because i know that if i stay in this path and do my absolute best to find the perfect career, i would be happy for myself and my family. to those in a similar position as me, my word of advice is to just follow what you think is right for you, follow what will make you happy because it is you who will be living with that decision <3 i don't regret my choice."	0

for those wondering, the way how honey pot ants get their abdomens so big with fluids, it done by feeding a freshly emerged adult ant tons of food while their exoskeleton is still soft. this allows the gaster to stretch bigger than normal leading to how the ants become so plump. they do this because if a shortage of food comes, the other ants can get it from the ants that store it in their large abdomens called repletes. it really is fascinating thing to see happen.	2

"As someone who grew up in New Jersey, I do love salt water taffy.  But sub sandwiches are the real iconic food from NJ.  The term ""submarine sandwich"" was coined in my hometown of Paterson by an Italian immigrant (thanks Wikipedia).  White House Subs in Atlantic City is one of the Jersey Shore's oldest sub shops, and of course the Jersey Mike's chain started from in Pt. Pleasant.   (Yes, your local deli probably makes a better sandwich. But JM's subs are at least far superior to Subway...)"	2

"What I find most interesting of all of this is how the underlying mechanisms for carnivory are rooted-pun intended-in the genomes of many plants, since they're usually used for defense against pathogens and herbivorous insects. With how common knowledge carnivorous plants are, it really surprises me that they aren't used as examples of how evolution works with what it has. Also, makes one realise how plants are very much alive and ""aware"" of the world surrounding them"	2

"Magical realism is not from Colombia because the term is European in concoction. However, when European writers viewed the way Latin American writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of ""magical"". They viewed these stories through a lens of exotification, without realising that it's ALL real and that it's a description of the absurdities found in Latin American societies. If we think about what exotification is, it's about seeing what's mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it. It's very much about ignorance and how what we don't understand can often appear magical. As a result, how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered. This is why magical realism, in my opinion, does not exist. It's a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre."	1

One thing that this is proof of is that mankind was a lot smarter and a lot more advanced than we give ourselves credit for, Ive believe the pyramids were made by manpower and engineering my entire life. They probably didnt quarry the stones they probably made them, and its very well possible to pull that stone if you but 100s or even 1000s if people to pull it. I also believe they used larger animals like elephants to help pull them quicker. Plus mankind was very strong and not fat and lazy like now so yea you get a bunch strong people to pull it they can Ive seen power lifter body builders pull big rigs by themself, they probably had some kind of technique they made it be able to move and where they made the stones was probably close by	2

"What I have gleamed from this is that I'll definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment. The specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions, and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes. 

I love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered. It gives people a chance who normally wouldn't be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them. I personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to long-ranged weapons when your weapon doesn't have the kit to contend. Definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple, because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you."	2

Spent the first seven years of my career teaching Florencia 13 gangbangers in Huntington Park, Ca. They were middle  schoolers and spent the better part of the day trying to keep their pants up. But as tough as they wanted you to believe they were, most of them were just babies trying to fit in. Then I moved to a high school and stayed in touch with two who went in different directions. One is now a Highway Patrol officer. The other was murdered by his cousin at the direction of a rival gang. To this day, I feel more affection than fear for these lost souls.	0

I hope to see more of Ana. I can imagine discussing concepts like this in depth in your non native language would be extremely difficult. But I also think that in situations like that, the different viewing angle can be very revealing. For example, there are words in native culture's languages that describe entire concepts in the English language, and vice versa. Sometimes things that are hidden from one perspective become obvious when looked at from another, because parallels between concepts emerge, beyond the language itself. I think I may have just broken my brain.... hahaha. Anyway, I love these. Thanks to everyone who was on it, and of course Brian!	1

10:38 just an extra note about using SHA for passwords: while it can be used, its often not the best choice. SHA was designed to be fast to compute making it very useful for older hardware and things like signatures, but you typically want the exact opposite for passwords. For a password hashing algorithm, you want it as slow as possible until it starts annoying users. That way, an attacker will be able to calculate fewer hashes per second while brute forcing. As of right now, the usual choices for password hashing are bcrypt or argon2id, both of which were designed to be slow.	1

"That glass pane-beacon thing was neat, I liked that. Though I find beacon beams kind of unsightly in general. I kind of wish you could have the boosted effect without the beam. I know Vanilla Tweaks has a resource to have them be invisible to me, but that doesn't mean EVERYONE isn't seeming my base just SURROUNDED in beams. Maybe they could make tinted glass function as a ""beam nullifier"" while still maintaining effects? That'd be nice."	2
Brooke's videos have helped me get great scores on the SAT and ACT, including a 750 reading and writing! I'm sure these scores have helped me get in to UF with a scholarship, especially since I go to a big high school with limited course offerings. Thank you Brooke, and GO GATORS!	2
"Greatest point for me was, "" work like everyone's trying to take it away from you."" 
Almost every industry I've been in I trusted too much and right others, including my managers and they took my knowledge and passed it as if it was there's. They took it from me. I don't trust like that anymore and I don't teach everything I know anymore because of that. Knowledge is power."	0

"I love your channel. The technical details are perfect. 

Im an engineer and I work with batteries as a hobby. There are two kinds of batteries that are LiON. One is protected and the other is unprotected. 

The protected ones prevent over-charging and over-discharging as well as over current. The unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection. Guess which people choose for their vaping. 

Lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density. They are damaged by over charging and over discharging. Cheap chargers dont behave and will over charge. Few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge. 

So why dont people use protected cells?  Generally those have too low current to make vaping possible. The current draw to instantly heat to 200C is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in, causing things to not work or work much more slowly."	2

Congrats, Carrie.  You're officially my favorite non-Green-Brothers (hereafter NGB), Crash Course Host. None of the other NGB CC Hosts manage to hold my interest long enough to watch their stuff.   You've got a good mixture of interesting subject matter and a pleasant delivery style.  The GB's are both naturally funny and that works for the.  I feel like the other NGB Hosts try to be too much like the GB's and it comes off false.  For what it's worth.  Keep up the good work.	2

8:30 In the video the 48th Panzer Corps is shown linking up with the encircled 14th Panzer Corps North of Stalingrad, but it was actually 51st Army Corps.

9:17 The Stukas shown attacking the Soviets in the outskirts of Stalingrad are depicted with cannons under their wings but these would not be attached onto Stukas until later in 1943.

9:59 Hitler took command from Army Group A in the South, removing Wilhelm List from command, not Army Group B's commander, von Weichs

17:25 Actually it was 4th Panzer Army not 4th Army. These are two different units.

19:00 Erich Von Manstein not Friedrich Von Manstein and he was not overall commander of the Army rather he was commander of the Don front

20:34 We say Paulus counted only 34,000 men still alive but we should have said only 34,000 still capable of bearing arms.

This is great. Focus is key. A playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience. For those interested in R and python, the latest R studio IDE is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate. It can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in R and statistics you can run ML scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ.	2

But then those are the same ppl, who will disregard any fact, that doesnt fit their tinfoil hat theory and cherrypick usable facts, they twist and change to fit them, or just plain invent ""facts"".
Sorry, if Im pissing off all the conspiracy buffs, but when I hear hoofbeats, my first thought isnt zebras, or even worse, aliens."	0

34:17 Do you see it? The big edge pieces which everything turns around are actually the centers, the cloverleaves are actually the edges, and for the corners, half of them look like centers, and the other half are actually hidden inside the puzzle. This means you actually have to look on the inside of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there, and that just makes it really hard.	0

But the dragonflies were our friends. Youd see them gliding back and forth just over our heads, catching the mosquitoes which swarmed around us.

"Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future, 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this Earth, hoping you'll find someone else
'Cause, yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to Heaven, so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (yeah, ayy, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (ayy, yeah)
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed"	1

as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach.  this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting.  it is a huge vector for exploit.  it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself	0
"Interesting note: Real wasabi is difficult to cultivate and package and ship. It also grows only in a specific riverbank environment, which makes real wasabi expensive and in low supply. When young, real wasabi is a bit sweet not spicy. The ""wasabi"" that comes with your sushi dinner in America, it is most often just horseradish with green food coloring. This green-dyed horseradish replacing actual wasabi is known in the food world as an ersatz or a replica food."	1

I wish that when people talked about types of skin damage, they'd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin. we don't get red rashes after sunburn. even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyper-pigmentation. the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we don't see the same change in colors around the wound sight. not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs, 99% of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues.	0

"Trying to test out of bio 101 so I can eventually get my third degree: NURSING (thanx Hank)
Along with that here is what I quickly typed down as a sort of SUMMARY, feel free to fix:

? William Prout discovered our stomachs have hydrochloric acid and discovered chemical composition of urea. Also discovered food is divided into carbs, fats, and proteins

? Carbohydrates are the source of all energy 

? Carbs are made of sugars with the simplest being monosaccharides

? Glucose, a monosaccharide, number 1 sugar that comes from the sun

? Fructose, same chemical as glucose, but arranged differently, and is sweeter

? Disaccharides are two monosaccharides put together

? Sucrose, fructose and glucose connected, is a disaccharide joined by a covalent bond

? Polysaccharides are thousands of simple sugar units

? Cellulose is a bunch of glucose molecules

? Bread is made of starch and amylase

? Our bodies store carbs in form of glycogen in our muscle until we need to use them

? We store our energy long term through fat aka lipids

? Lipids are non polar and cant dissolve in water

? Fats are made of glycerol and fatty acids

? Saturated fats dont have double bonds, while unsaturated fats do

? Trans fat do not exist in nature and are unsaturated and bad for the body

? Omega 3 fats, unsaturated, are essential but we need to eat them in order to get them

? Phospholipids form cell membrane walls to keep bad stuff out and good stuff in

? Phospholipids are one end polar and one end non polar

? Steroids, a phospholipid made of 4 carbon rings, are used to make cholesterol

? Proteins of made of 20 amino acids which do everything for the body

? Nitrogen can only be gotten into our bodies from food, via foods high in protein

? Polypeptides are formed by long chains of amino acids

? The 9 essential amino acids, which are bodies cant make on their own, are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine"	1

The ONE thing I am really grateful for in the videos by SoL is the fact that they repeatedly assert how everyone is weird. And that we all pretend to be normal and acceptable.

Now, I have slowly got myself to think that it is all okay, that everyone is weird and I should just embrace myself - an eternal dynamic mess.	2

Economy's fine, no cause for concern, just like in 1980, 1990, 2001, 2007, 2020, right?.

"There were several things that were not taken into account when evolving over time.  They stuck way too closely to frog morphology and tried to hammer-fit it into each of the niches.  Amphibians have varied morphology now that were advantageous for land dwelling amphibians but were not mentioned.    Amphibians that become completely terrestrial without need for water as part of their life cycle no longer meet the definition of ""amphibian"".  Every evolved amphibian retained frog eyes and body structure.  Evolution is also influenced by things never mentioned as well.  Predator prey relationships drive evolution.  Fast running prey animals and predictors are an example.  Size also dictates evolution due to environmental factors.  Amphibians respiratory system is a limiting factor as many don't have lungs and breathe by uptake of oxygen through the skin or primitive lungs.  This limits size.  The larger the animal the more oxygen is needed.  That's why lungs evolved.  This would also change mouth and nose shape."	1

"The third game would have been a lot more interesting with one change. The platforms are hexagons, much smaller, and with several more of them on screen at once. So that you're always in danger of falling into a hole, and not exactly sure where the path is going.

Furthermore, after reading several other comments, I agree about crediting the developers. However, everyone needs to realise that the prices were agreed upon before development, and the prices were integral to the experiment. If the developers were not OK with the amounts they were paid, then they wouldn't have accepted the job."	1

I think over time, as you get more experience and have done quite a few interviews, you'll just naturally start to feel more relaxed. Another thing I like to think about before an interview that calms me down a bit is that it's not the end of the world if you don't get the job. You'll still be ok, there'll be another place.	2

You mentioned that bioinformatics is the field that uses computers to analyze genetic data when statistical methods aren't enough, but when statistical methods are enough, that is a field called quantitative genetics. And using it we can often tell whether a trait is genetic without having to know which specific genes are involved. It can also help give candidates for molecular genetic study to find the genes relating to those traits.	1

14:42, this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me. Out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses, this one's just different. The game was over lol. It's not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown. The game is literally over, all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and that's it. The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point. Even if the apposing team has time to foul you, you hit just 1 free throw and it's over. Even if you miss both, they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time... Long story short, that throw lost them the game after OT lol... Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards. Gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history.	0

I've been a shortwave listener and Ham Radio operator many years. Number stations are a practical way of sending coded messages to agents throughout the world.  If an agent enters a foreign country, it's not hard to purchase a shortwave radio, set up a long  piece of wire and tune in a frequency at a pre-planned UTC time.  The agent has the key - hears and writes down the numbers, breaks the code with the key and destroys the message.  Back in 2001, number stations were going crazy across all bands day and night.  Something was going on.	1

I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market, all that changed when I encountered mitnickcorp , I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of *MitnickCorp??ORG* that has made me over good ?oin "	1

CS requires a person who is patient, persistent, creative in solutions... Basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done. That's how you can know. Further as you grow into CS you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem, even if not from this field: think, research, learn, craft. Every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps. You will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed, and it's ok, because you also learn that progress is through error after error, only for the new problem to come to you, and apply the same process; you already can handle being overwhelmed.	2

"I feel like getting rid of the mini was a stupid decision on there part. I feel a redesigned little bit bigger 14 mini would do really well. 
I also see no reason for anyone to upgrade. I upgraded from a 12 mini to a regular 13 when I switched carriers. I can personally say the phones are nearly Identical in every way. If thats any indication of what to expect from the 14 line, I would say if you have an 11pro, any 12, or 13 model theres not much of a reason to upgrade. IOS 16 isnt a design overhaul anything. Ill be keeping my iphone 13 for a long time. 
The watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb. If you can find a series 6 or 7 buy it especially when you can get a series 7 for around $280-$340 brand or refurbished from apple. Instead of getting the new SE which is essentially a series 6. 
I think upgrading the watch or Iphone this year is already a skip.
The product to be most excited for is the 10th gen ipad. Getting way better features. I will def be upgrading my mini 5 to and ipad 10th gen especially since itll have usb-c. I wish they would do the same with the iphone, airpods & apple pencil. 
I cant wait for the October event. I think if you have an apple watch SE,5,6,7 you dont need to upgrade your watch either."	1

"'The sorrows of young werther' is a fabulous book, despite the tragic-romantic style. It is not only based on Goethe's own disappointing experiences with women, but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him.
I'm no expert on Goethe but I also understand he completed the colour wheel which Isaac Newton started.
It is important to understand that in Goethe's time there was a 'Romantic movement'; nothing to do with the definition of the word today, but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment. Goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th C called 'Sturm und Drang' (Storm and Stress), a small group including Schiller, of 'angry young men' who embraced the Ideals of the Romantic movement.
By the way, if you haven't done a video on the Romantic movement please do.
The Romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment, such as science and rationalism, and its clinical, dry, detached way of categorising humanity and the world.
The Romantics were not an organised group as such. One of the best descriptions of (the Romantics) was written by my old Philosophy teacher - ""The declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of 'culture' and 'rationality' which barred the way, both historically and personally, to a ""return to nature"": this is nature the unbounded, wild and ever-changing, nature the sublime and powerful. Were humans to behave 'Naturally', freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality, then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed, and humans could live a nobler life. In the name of nature, the romantics worshipped: liberty, power, love, violence, imagination, irrationality, the Greeks, the 'primitives' or anything that aroused their emotional responses, while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves."""	1

I really respect how Scott is a big Nintendo fan, but isn't fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgia's sake.

And I know the number of tutorials isn't quite as high, but I would recommend Godot to 2D beginners - it's relatively clean and easy to pick up, completely open source, and less than 1GB (I think the Steam version is ~950MB, but the full package straight off the website is closer to 100MB, and yet still fully functional... so very quick and easy to try out). I really like GDScript (Pythonesque) and the scene heirarchy is pretty intuitive.

I admit I keep getting hung up on optimisation... not just because, like you,  I work in another development area during my day job, but because I want anything I make to be playable on a potato if possible... but it really slows down/halts my progress... need to shoulder my way through that, like you recommend."	2

You quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play.  That is a win for the Xbox, because it has direct integration with PC.  You can chat with anyone on PC, but also directly play with them in a slew of GamePass games that silently support cross-play between PC and Xbox.  Playstation is doubling down on the walled-garden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization (perpetuating the console wars, really).  No brainer, Microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience, including online.	2

It warms my heart to see animals trying to save other animals, even a small fish, where a human would have left it to die. Animals are so much smarter than we think, they know things even we do not. Animals care way more than humans do. They are not greedy but only take what they need and help others to survive, even ones that are not of its own kind. That is the true way to live in this world. Animals deserve so much more kindness than we give them. Next time you see a animal, give it the respect and kindness it deserves.	2

Great video. You did great explaining this. That said, I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps. Specifically data acquisition and cleaning. Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research. Furthermore, it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found. Do some field work, say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it. Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you dont figure out until your back? Oh well. This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies. All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now? Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned! THE FIRST TWO STEPS (ACQUISITION AND CLEANING) ARE SO IMPORTANT!!!!!	2

The thing is, if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule, you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility. You must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time, and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially. Leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows they're taking time off. This also empowers your teams, letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders.	2

Realizing that no matter what happens, I'll be okay, is exactly how I survived my childhood. I used to stress so much then after so many dramatic plot twists, I realized if I survived all that, I will survive whatever else comes my way and that's when I stopped stressing as much. I hadn't really connected it with confidence before but I can see the connection now. Interesting. ??	2

You are a fabulous teacher.  No ego, showing off or any of the things that discourage new cubers.  So clear and user friendly.  I am an older person who has cubed for 15 years. I solve many cubes, cuboids, odd shaped magic cubes, and supercubes and these often require the basic moves you teach here.  So while this is very beginner it is also very useful for advanced complex cubes that can't be solved with advanced algs,  A pleasure!! I will show this video to a young neighbor whom I just gave a 3x3 and she is very excited about it.  I feel she'd do well with your great teaching style!!	2

My grandmother was born in 1944. She was the youngest of five children. The village where she was born was located in communist controlled territory, so the EAM/ELAS forces would regularly interrogate locals in case of any anti-communist activity. Her father decided it was best to stay neutral and simply co-operate with the communists. Then some guy in the village who had some dispute with him framed him for anti-communist activity. The whole family (my grandmother being just a few months old) was transported to a prison camp set up by the EAM/ELAS for anyone accused of opposing them. There, they rounded up all the men and executed them. My great-grandfather was beheaded with an axe and his body was thrown into a well. Soon, the prisoners were liberated and they returned to their homes. My grandmother grew up without a father, something which still deeply affects her to this day. Because of that, she simply dismisses anything remotely left-wing because of all the trauma caused by EAM/ELAS. The Greek Civil War is one of the darkest pages in Greek history, and you can still see how it has divided us.	1

When you have high interest rates environment, it's logical to buy consumer staples and not discretionary, because people (consumers) will buy what they need.

Fun Fact: During the initial membership drafting of the Avengers Initiative, the World Security Council considered releasing Blonsky from the custody and get him to join the Avengers. The Council cited Blonsky as a decorated war hero and believed that havoc he caused was just self-defense from Hulk, but S.H.I.E.L.D. objected, being aware of Blonsky's violent and unpredictable nature. Thanks to the combined efforts of Phil Coulson, Jasper Sitwell, and Tony Stark, Thaddeus Ross subsequently disapproved Blonsky's release, so Bruce Banner became a potential candidate instead.	1

"The composer of this is the piano player, Igor Krutoy. He came out of semi-retirement to work with Dimash. He has composed for people like Lara Fabian and Andrea Bocelli. ??

Igor wrote a post about this song on his IG:

""One evening, about three months before the ""New Wave"", Dimash called me and asked if I could write ""Ave Maria "" for him, explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style... Coincidentally I had a free evening and I gladly sat down at the piano and, remembering the Italian formula of responsibility, worked with inspiration until I achieved the desired result. . . After taking a few days for the composition to ""rest"" in my ears, soul, and heart, I sent it to Dimash, who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear. And of course, the reception and applause given to Dimash by the audience at the ""New Wave"" show what a happiness it is to do what I love, to write for such a genius singer, to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand... Just a short essay on "" What is happiness?"""""	2

Guys, a quick note that you do NOT need all the high-end tech in order to do well at college. If you can (and you should), save as much money as you can while at college, pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets. Get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 4-6 years (such as laptop). Don't overspend on phone, headphones, lamps, tablets, etc.	1

536 AD is the estimated timeframe that the Krakatoa volcano experienced an extremely massive eruption that caused a column of smoke, ash, and debris 13 miles high.  So much material was ejected into the atmosphere that it shrouded the Earth causing temperature drops and ensuing human suffering. Krakatoa would erupt massively again around 1200 and the most recent climate-changing eruption was in the 1880s. The 1880s eruption was estimated to be equivalent to 160 megatons, the Tsar Bomba was a measly 57 megatons in comparison.	0

"The kid wasn't ""front line""; when Friend went out walking, he stumbled across the toads doing their normal thing; foraging. The kid was out learning.
Toadette knew that Friend wasn't a danger to fish-kind. The movie drop subtext hints that, like Starship Troopers, the ""monsters"" weren't the random violent one; Gruner started it. Likely by killing some/many of them, and fish-napping a female member of their tribe to use as his own personal fleshlight. 

Peace was plenty possible and Friend figured it out, he just wasn't very smart as shown in the rest of the video. All he had to do was offer them Gruner, at least at that point. 

Even at the beginning of the movie, we're set to think he's going to be attacked when they come knocking on his door; but that's the director using our bias and expectation in monster movies. They were curious, sure, and maybe marking the territory, but they weren't attack-oriented until after Friend got antsy. 

I wonder if the tadpole Gruner killed was his own!?"	1

"Apparently, it's because they're cheaply made. The parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile, and the buttons are suboptimal. Shoulder buttons are reported to give out because of poor soldering and lack of reinforcements. There's also an issue with wiring, as the (+) button and the R button are wired together, while the opposite joycon is wired regularly. 

In other words, the joycons, while the optimal method to play the Switch in its entirety, are poorly designed for their tasks."	0

"Here is the Transcript.

The literature review is not an essay, it is not a research paper - the literature review is part of your essay, the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe stand-alone product if you're master's degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for. But regardless of whether part of the research essay or stand-alone product, one thing the literature review does not do is - It doesnt prove, state, illustrate, collaborate or develop your main point, that's in the body of your essay. The literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper. Well, what the heck does it do then?

Well, the literature review is divided into the following key terms: first is, the whole idea of what the heck in the literature? The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic. Now remember I said narrow topic, we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes, you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic, that's the first thing that you need to know. The literature is published, peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic. Second thing, the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed. What the heck of a review, well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it. What is that snapshot going to capture? That snapshot going to capture major concepts, the major point, the major outcome, the major whatever in that source. Its not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot. Once you get all those snapshot done, you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of time-line situation, maybe not, but the key years is youre going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element, may be on a time line type of situation.

Now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why they're hack are you doing all this stuff. Well, I think there are three reasons, probably, why you're doing all this stuffs in school. In the first one, off course, to improve your own understanding, as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics ?into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding, build your background, build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline. Then in of course in this paper, when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject you're going to be demonstrating that knowledge, demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment. But you know, the real purpose of a literature review is, its a reader service, it something you doing as a favor for your readers, what are you doing you are bringing them up to date.

Whats the first thing you and that old friend do? You ask each other- hey what you been doing all these years? Fill me in, update me, you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in, you updating them. By bringing them up to date, then you can start at the present again. ?You see what Im saying, you can bring them along that time-line of the path, letting them know the key element, the major concepts, the key element in your life and what you dare? Boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literature's review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas, past scholars, the past researchers boom and then come your idea."	0

Freeing your mind from consumerism is so important. We're literally trained from young to always want more, to never be satisfied to compare ourselves to our neighbors and what they have. I was always a natural saver, but struggled a bit in not comparing myself to others. It's still something I work on, but over time have gotten better. It definitely helped that I realized the image others put forward, the majority of the time is financed by debt! That's not something I'm interested in at all. I hope more people learn this concept and actively practice it. I'll definitely talk about it on my channel as well.	2

6:36 Yeah she shouldve tested the henna before, because henna usually stays for a week few days, depends how long you keep it on for or how much you apply. I also think that instead of rubbing it off paper she shouldve washed her face. Every time I get henna done on my hands I wash my hands I dont wipe it off, some people wipe it off too but wiping is better for your hands, when you apply henna you should wash your face. Maybe cause she didnt wash her face it turned out like, or maybe because she shouldve just tested it out.	1

"Great tip! I've added vinager to the poaching water,  and when doing multiple eggs used rings to hold the individual eggs in place which can shape them kind of ugly (into rounds) compared to yours. I've used small tuna tins that I cut the top and bottom off of for this. 
Pre soaking in vinager is much smarter too!"	2

I think the point Gotham is making, especially with the Ruy Lopez/ Sicilian, is that openings of that caliber require such precision and accurate play that unless you're willing to really spend a lot of time with minute details and study, you're going to play them wrong. Even if you win games with them, it'll be in spite of your opening, not because of it (generally speaking). He's clearly talking about beginner/ intermediate caliber players, chess purists can relax.	1

The thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more. I've had a couple of friends with RE: 8 on PC that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better. And for me personally. I bought the ultimate version of dying light 2. I really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause I thought my PC couldn't handle it or something but then I tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter. I hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch. It will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases.	0

"The Lummi Nation refer to the local orcas as Qwe 'lhol mechen, which means 'our relatives who live under the sea' or 'the people under the waves.' Orcas live in tight-knit families. In most cases, both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives (this is especially true for Southern and Northern Residents). Orcas are incredibly intelligent and social. Their limbic system (the part of the brain that processes emotion) is incredibly developed and complex. Each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate. They're the only species, besides humans, pilot whales, beluga whales and narwhals, that go through menopause.

Famous Southern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Lolita, Granny, Ocean Sun, Tahlequah (who made worldwide headlines when she was spotted carrying her dead calf for 17 days), Moby Doll, Shamu, Luna (there's a documentary about Luna called The Whale)

Famous Northern Resident orcas (fish eaters) : Namu, Corky, Tsitika, Eve, Sharky, Top Notch, Springer (the only orca to have been successfully re-integrated back into the wild)

Famous Transient orcas (mammal-eaters) : Lonesome George, Fatfin, Chainsaw, Esperanza, Sidney and her children, Raksha and her five daughters"	2

i love this new update, it implements a rework for basically every card and a new middle piece a jail system which is very cool and adds incetives to protect and keep alive the monkey since he can save the king, giving him a great passive buff also the fish queens that even now are fake is still a great advantage to have and i personally like more that way and the new rook with his flying abilities making a great way to protect other pieces and more gameplay variety and finally a little edit to the color of the chess board who i agree the reasoning for, tho is probably harder to get a blueish board than a black and white one but is not a big issue and after mentioning all of that i will give to this update a 14/10, amazing work	2

"As for the rock, its placement in a river suggests one of two things: That it wasn't always in the water, that the river has changed course over time, or perhaps increased in volume, or

That it could have been washed there by a megaflood from the sudden catastrophic melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet that covered most of Canada and parts of the U.S. during the last ice age. It could even be that the markings were made by the Clovis people who disappeared from the fossil record at the end of the Younger Dryas (the ending period of the last ice age).
What the markings are NOT from, though, is f***ing aliens."	1

"AI is the most important one, a lot of people think AI is going to somehow mean self awareness, consciousness at some point.
The main implications of AI is that it is self improving, the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen
is that AI is going to overtake humans in a lot of things, including research and science. It is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change
everything about life far more than the industrial era did. For  example, 300 years from now we can have an AI program that has been improving itself for 300 years.
We lose about 1.4 million people each year from car accidents, and that is just fatalities, there are also many more injuries. So while I understand people being
skeptical about machines driving cars, as time goes on it is not even going to be close, AI is going to be able to do many, many things better than humans.
At some point, these quantum computers are going to make AI, they could program an AI to make a better AI of itself, an improved version.
Then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it, etc. etc.
There is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens."	1
"It is true that we didn't hear Daemon said ""The Heir For A Day"" and his account might be true after all when he said we each mourn our own ways. We are only told via Otto's report, and we know they despised each other. The labeling could be interpreted in either good or bad way. Just like the title ""The Queen Who Never Was"" could be considered a mockery but also it could mean you acknowledge that she should be the queen. Maybe Daemon is indeed honoring his dead nephew. One thing is for sure though, i think his love for his brother is genuine, however rogue his ways are. He knows his brother is weak and he sees Otto Hightower for what he is, he really wanted to protect his brother from crows that's waiting for a feast. He's definitely going to be a grey character and they tend to be the most interesting."	1

This got me so hyped, especially Hrithik being the highlight for me. Also, the it factor for me was to see such a diverse talented cast and the bgm as well. Achara saying that it wasn't convincing actually makes me believe that she's just still adjusting to seeing Hrithik in a negative role because those eyes stood out for me, giving that maniac sadistic vibe that it was supposed to.

"Destin, I think I enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument. To the issue of exclusives. I think the strategy of MS has already been spelled out. 

What I think MS plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy. They will have console exclusives, but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is Sony's strategy. It just means they will release on multiple devices from PCs, to TV's, to mobile phones, and through cloud. MS has expanded agreesively.

But I personally do not think their games will go to Sony consoles like most people tend to think because Sony are their competition."	2

Good video. Im in the least popular branch in CS, cs theory research. I'm glad you mentioned induction, if one dives into program verification, you'll see that induction is essential to doing any kind of proof because induction corresponds to recursion in programming. Induction on the natural numbers may not be interesting, but think about induction on your data types and proving properties about them. In fact, induction does not only apply to natural numbers, but any inductively defined set.	2

"""House of the Dragon"" is inspired by George's book called ""Fire and Blood"" which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the Game of Thrones universe, the tragic fight was called  ""The Dance of Dragons"", and this event takes place 100 years before Daenerys.
The funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself, that's because ""The Dance of Dragons"" was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written, the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of Westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen.
And yes, it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished, so for the series we can expect less seasons than GOT, and a more complete story, different from the ending of got that was not written by George since the books still are not finished, but all the characters of ""House of the dragon"" were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes.

"As a game developer I have always taken the ""boring stuff"" incredibly seriously. If you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game, you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire game's campaign or whatever else. In fact - and I discovered this the same way you did, Mark - by building that framework, often times you will accidentally end up building an MVP or demo at the same time.

I did this as well. I'm still working on my first game, but just recently, I started closing in on the final lines of code for my Unreal Engine 5 framework that I will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off (as in, when I'm not the only employee). Well, I'm working on my framework, and I look at the level I've built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added, and I realized, I basically just built a pre-alpha demo for my game; all I need is to make the level actually look good (because my level design skills are awful) and I basically now have a pre-alpha project. It's funny how that can happen sometimes.

Either way, I always take this stuff seriously. Frameworks are everything in my opinion - having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier, since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it."	1

Junho and MinWoo are room-mates, that's why you saw him in the mirror when Junho was brushing his teeth. And at the end her father kept repeating the fact that she got him sushi to point out how ironic it was that his daughter went to a high-end restaurant but got him sushi (which is the japanese version of Gimpap, which is literally what he sells and what he made her for breakfast). It's ironic cuz if it were anybody else who went to an expensive restaurant, they would have brought back something that he usually wouldn't eat, not sushi. And in the car, the lawyer lady told him to stop talking to Young Woo about whales entirely, which is not what he did. He didn't listen to her cuz he doesn't find it annoying. The reason he set up a specific time is so she wouldn't call him while he's in the bathroom or if he's busy. Also, you could see he was disappointed when she said she has nothing else to say to him, and that's because he wants her to be curious about him but she isn't. So he already likes her.	1

"I am a chem teacher and am relying on your videos during covid-19.  Your site is the only one I have found to explain the material the way I do with the same depth of content and accurate.  Thanks you for helping me and my students make this transition to online distance learning smooth and mostly painless.  


In addition, since I have found you to be such an excellent instructor (and parents and kids clash at times), I have you ""teach"" my 8 year old (2nd grade) multiplying and dividing fractions.  I then act as his tutor to explain concepts (such as negative numbers) that you introduce and clear up his confusion.  I find it works out so much better this way, because when I am both teacher and tutor to him his frustration level rises rapidly when he does not grasp a concept immediately."	2

However, you were the only one who was able to help me (only other channel is Supertutor TV ) Also, this happened to be the last SAT I could ever take since Im a senior.

I know you don't read your comments Gordon, however I've just 'practiced' making rice and it turned out better than anticipated! 50g of rice and 150ml of cold water and I followed the method you described. You did say 8 to 10 minutes and I gave it 9. The result was extremely satisfactory and I combined it with some leftovers and have had a lunch with no waste. I know how to do the onion as my daughter has already shown me. I'm off out shortly to buy a steel as I usually sharpen my knife on a whetstone, which can be more of a chore than using a steel. I'm 61 and everyday is a schoolday.... I've so wanted to master rice:-) Cheers!	2

"SUMMARY NOTES:
00:00 Intro
-The problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information.

-The ""second brain"" system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information.

-The ""second brain"" system has helped Ali in his own life, and can hopefully help others as well.

-The ""second brain"" system uses CODE as an acronym to explain its core foundations - Capture, Organize, Distill, Express.

00:41 What is a Second Brain and why should you have one?
- A second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas.

- Building a second brain can help you express your creativity, be more productive and make better decisions. 

- Every job today involves knowledge work of some kind, and a second brain can help you with inputting, processing, and outputting information.

- The methodology for building a second brain has four parts: Capture, Organize, Distill and Express (CODE).

04:56 C (Capture)
- Ali discusses different ways of capturing information, both manually and automatically.

-Ali captures his thoughts and ideas in Apple Notes.

- He also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

- Having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything.

- Ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day, as well as highlights from books, articles, and podcasts.

08:32 O (Organise)
- Ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in one's learning.

- This means that when you come across something relevant, you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take, rather than creating a new category for it.

- You can still search for specific information using control F or command F if needed.

- This system is especially helpful when working on long-term projects with many moving parts.

11:07 D (Distill)
- Ali talks about a method called progressive summarization, which is basically like highlighting, but on steroids.

- This is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

- Different than highlighting we're used to in school - it's not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain, but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important.

11:45 E (Express)
-The ""E"" in the second brain system stands for Express, meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas, you need to share them with the world in some way.

-Sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback, collaborate with others, and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work.

-Without expressing our ideas, they are essentially useless - it's important to find a way to share your creativity with others.

13:09 How my Second Brain has helped Ali
-The course/book has helped Ali become more productive, but also more creative and less stressed in general.

-The system taught Ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts - working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one, most of the work is already done. 

-The system has also helped with his teaching work - he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information."	2

"I've taken the SAT 3 times. The most frustrating part about the SAT is that unless you're at an advanced level in math or above the ""normal"" level for your grade, there's a high chance you won't understand or even recognize over 50% of the material and questions. The first time I took it I barely understood a lot of the math on it because I wasn't even completely through Algebra 2. 

Long story short I hate standardized testing and I feel as though a lot of kids are set up for failure T_T. I'm lucky I got to take it multiple times this year since I understand most of the math now."	0

Pierre... You truly changed my life with your sound. Ever since my junior year of HS when my brother played Doublemint in the car I have been attached to your music.

I have always loved 50 interviews. He drops knowledge like a great philosophy professor. He's always had a blueprint, a map, a plan since he first came into the game with his mixtapes. He drops gems on life, business, goals, etc. He's a marketing genius. No one can hold a candle to him when it comes to going from the bottom to the top and maintaining, while still recreating yourself and evolving as a businessman. Give this man his ?? roses while he's here, not after he's gone. He's one of my role models.	2

24:00 Interestingly enough, at high enough optical intensities (beyond those attainable by current lasers) it is possible for photons to interact with one another. This study of photon-photon interactions is known as nonlinear optics. For example, two photons can combine to create a photon with twice as much energy. However, due to these high intensities not being common in daily life, this isn't frequently observed outside of laboratories.	1

"i agree with everything you're saying, but how come you don't highlight the greatest gift of a computer science degree? problem solving. 

i struggled through school, but now looking back, im actually very glad i took these courses. for one, it taught me the limits of my knowledge and how much there is to learn. taking these classes don't make you an expert in the field. instead, it teaches introduces you to the fundamentals in the broad field of computer science. armed with this fundamental knowledge, you can have a much clearer perspective of how the pieces come together and allows you to problem solve better. 

sure, it doesn't teach you the practical skills, but problem-solving is an essential skill for any career especially in tech.
 when you strip away all the fancy frameworks and the technologies that come and go, at the core, what you have is computer science which you can use to build these solutions."	2

underrated? I agree hes extremely good at game development, but he also has millions of subscribers, millions more viewers, and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm. Not to mention Karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions, and one of the most wishlisted games on steam. Many other solo game-devs out there who pour just as much, if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that. Someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what id call underrated, there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like Dani. Im not saying its his fault or anything, I watch him and support him, im just saying the claim that hes underrated, let alone the most underrated, is incredibly wrong as far as im concerned.	2

"Apologies for not watching the whole video.  As a former student and a parent of students, I know the system was broken long before common core.  I remember in college, my English 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide, because I was so deficient on the basics--though I did well in English all through school.  I had to take remedial math, because my high school didn't prepare me for college courses--though I graduated with the required credits.  

Things have gone down since I was a student, and my kids had schools with very high standards, but very low expectations.  That means there were a lot of advanced classes offered--like calculus--but so many ways to accept failure.  They had to take history and social studies, but only had to PASS one!  The policy of ""No Child Left Behind"" was an additional failure, as it meant no one failed or was held back, even though they wouldn't graduate on time.  Kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted.  

Too much government involvement means teachers aren't allowed to TEACH!  We have some phenomenal teachers, who are underpaid, with far too much non-teaching responsibility heaped on them.  Schools aren't just expected to educate students.  Now, they've got to feed them, clothe them, teach them manners and how to get along, look out for abuse, deal with all their special needs, (and accompanying IEPs,) head off bullying, deal with allergies and medical conditions, worry about gender identity and sexuality, discipline fairly, deal with ""helicopter parents,"" check the boxes for college prep, and deal with the ever-present worry over school shootings.  

With all we're expecting from schools and teachers, it's a wonder anyone goes into this profession, or stays once they see the outlook.  

Common core, like No Child Left Behind, is a great idea on paper, that fails in implementation.  My kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were well-educated.  There was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses, and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students.  It meant even more testing for students--to judge whether their teachers were up to the task.  At the same time, they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do better--like tenure.  They promoted the best teachers out of the classroom.  They took away teaching assistants due to the costs.  They increased class sizes.  And they started charter schools--which were experimental programs.  

Imagine if all those billions spent on common core, were used to pay teachers more--and get out of their way."	0

"Our pain moves in an area of ??vast sadness

We don't find paws that wipe the weights of steadfast fear off our shoulders

All suspicions wake up to the sound of doubt coming from the mouths of the traitors

Nothing compares to the sails departing from the ports of memories

Have you seen with the eyes of your dreams the mirage of years in the seasons of false wish?

Return to your deserted consciences, you poets who escaped from the prison of iron despair.

There are flowers waiting for your words for a winter touch in the summer of burning words.

"An animal evolving a foam-like cover instead of fur is such an interesting and original concept, goddamn. Now imagine if those foam glands slowly made the foam more firm.

You <,are so right, great insight! I started investing few years back and read all the old old-school rules. Turns out, above primitive analysis of a business, human ardour drives the stock market and always has, its just evolving, in no small part, as you point out, because of social media causing extreme polarization. The reality is that crypto/stock market is one of the toughest mental games in the world. Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid investments. Financial management is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from, and ends up haunting them in the near future. Putting our time and effort in activities and investments that will yield a profitable return in the future is what we should be aiming for. We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing, the market is so volatile now to be depending on the bull run to make a profit or investing without guidance, I advise everyone never to stop investing, never to stop improving, never to stop doing something new and to trade now with an Advisory who has a great experience. Taking this decision some months back has been my best decision so far, i have been able to day trade my crypto assets and increased my portfolio holdings to atop 12.05 BTC in profits with an elementary of 1.09 BTC with trade signal tips and guidance from my Investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore. I am able to scale through the demented stock/crypto deterioration and saved my investment. You all in search of a way to recover your loses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to her for crypto investment and for profitable trading system or mentorship. This is one of the best approach to support your assets incase it goes rough.>?eI???m @moorerobin OR What'sapp +12132627458 For more crypto investment ideas ..	2

Ich freue mich natrlich auf den Event und bin wie immer gespannt. Was ich aber mit meinem iPhone mache, wei? ich noch nicht. Ich bin mit dem 12'er noch immer vollkommen zufrieden und habe ber die vielen vorangegangenen Versionen und K?ufe gelernt, dass ich eigentlich mit dem neuen iPhone meist genau dasselbe mache, wie mit dem vorherigen. Eigentlich sollte ich das 12Pro erst ersetzen, wenn es entweder kaputt geht oder der Akku am Ende seines Lebens ist, beides trifft nicht zu. Vermutlich staune ich ber das neue iPhone und vielleicht bin ich neidisch auf sch?ne neue Farben, aber dann nehme ich meins aus der Hlle und stelle fest, dass mein Oceam Blue auch nicht so bel ist. ?? Zusammengefasst verspre ich keinen Wunsch oder gar Drang, ein neues iPhone anzuschaffen und bin mit meinem Happy. Vermutlich berspringe ich das 14'er auch noch, um dann beim 15er zuzuschlagen.	1

It's hardly surprising. Even in rich districts teachers are underpaid, undervalued, and overworked. They are expected to take on more responsibilities every year with fewer and fewer resources, all while administrators ignore their pleas and parents treat them like overqualified babysitters. My wife quit teaching several years ago. She was working 6-7 days a week and spending hundreds of dollars a month on supplies just to keep her classroom running, and the school gave her absolutely no support with unruly students.	0

"Hi Priya- thank you for this video. I am concluding my last year as a student receiving my BS in data analytics. And I have so many questions that are causing me anxiety. As I am nearing the end of my journey I have realized that the path in computer science ( DS/DA) is not structured like one probably imagined it would be. What I am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools (Python, SQL, tableau, R,) if whats important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them,  but the real challenge starts after graduating, in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights ?

Did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs?

My husband and I have relied on GPS to take us on long road trips. There have been several occasions where we would 'nope' out of a tiny road in the middle of nowhere when we requested a gas station from the GPS. It's gotten to the point that we only stop at gas stations along the highways because we've seen too many scary movies. I remember one time it told us the gas station was up ahead and all that was around us was miles of corn. Freaky!	1

This woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice. Some asmrtists, as fine as they are, do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners. There are patterns of sounds, which means some sounds will cause relaxation, other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers don't realize that these cannot be mixed. Me, for an example, hate very high pitched noises, hate plastic and eating sounds. Latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos. She just knows what's up.	0

The main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making. Although independent thinking was encouraged in the German army, the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf. The tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving. He also has the ability to kill all of those Shermans through their front armour at that range and cant even be sure they know his exact position. Essentially, the commander is a tool.	0

4 principles of teaching:
1) start off in the right place: explain the info in the terms that they already understand; start with an explanation and ask if it makes sense
2) don't go too far down the rabbit hole: it's better to explain a small amount that they will understand than make everything confusing
3) clarity beats accuracy: a simpler explanation gets the point across
4) explain why you think it's cool: show your enthusiasm for the subject or give examples of how its relevant to their lives"	1

Love the breakdown. I've gradually built my finance and made my first $100k through investing which i've used to start my jewellery business, and with what Ive learned over a decade investing, given enough time, solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount, but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out. So the onus is on newbies to beware. Having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out.	2

Be a teacher but forever a student. Listening in itself is a lost art. So difficult to run across a good listener. Joe Rogan comes to mind. I really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with Elon as his guest. I don't necessarily agree with Elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts. What I like about Joe is he gives his guest's time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs ( or agenda like so many on the tell a vision).  Being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort.	2

"Something important to know, for all who are interested in history and/or support Ukraine: 

Rus ought not to be confused with Russia, which derives its name from the Rus but historically is a completely different state, which almost all its existence was at war with the Rus. 

Just like the Holy Roman Empire was actually Germany, Russia is actually Muscovy, despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise. 

Its name Russia"" received only in 1721, when Peter I passed a decree to change Tsardom of Muscovys name into the Russian Empire (Russia originates from Rosia, name used by the Greek Orthodox Clergy in regards to Kyivan Rus')
Under the reign of Cathrine II Muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as Muscovites, and were forced to call themselves Russian. 

Lands that Russia claims were part of the original Rus, but actually weren't, are Novgorod, Suzdal, and Ryazan, since in historical texts of XI-XII centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from Rus. They can be considered parts of extended Rus, although their culture was distinct from main Rus.

In 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus ownership.

Russia is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and Russian historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.




Germany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didnt mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, thats exactly what Russia did in regards to Rus-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!"	1

It would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16 model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz; not great, but I would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if youre viewing movies. It sucks that Apple has made that limitation, but is that a limitation on the Thunderbolt or SoC ??? I feel that the argument that many people dont use a dual monitor setup is not really true, especially in the work place. My sister uses dual monitors working from home, and she uses one of those mini-work towers. The thing that tempts me the most about the Air, is the weight, portability, and the amount of power (given specific specs), its more or less well-rounded. However, if Im bumping up the storage and unified memory, I wouldnt be that far off from the M1 Pro 14 MacBook Pro price. Strangely, the 14 would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13 non-retina MacBook Pro ??. The only cool thing about that model is the upgradability, but even that is a novelty thats losing its veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to. Im hanging onto it as my backup computer. Really ought to start saving for a more up-to-date laptop. The smudging thing is annoying from what I see. Its an awesome color, but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all. Besides the size, portability and power, not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that Ive yet to experience. At work, I work with desktop towers and Im used to the noise, I suppose.	0

"Sounds great. If they released this and do a good job I could see this making people in the Samsung/PC Crowd finally switch to Apple's gated community. 
I say that as I am in the PC/Android community but the potential convenience, usefulness and practicality of these is immense. Using the iPhone to do the processing is so clever.

And the great thing about Apple products is how they quickly they become ubiquitous and most of us don't want to attract attention when they're out and about. 

I mean you'd be able to easily and seamlessly stream video calls, show whoever you're talking to what you're looking at in real time. When doing grocery shopping, getting takeaway, convenience store or any type of food store that'd be so convenient and useful. 
Or have information overlays whilst you're walking around town.

It< makes sense,  BTC and crypto is off helping to regulate, rather than pretend it won't ever happen.  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize.   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space. Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 12 btc from day-trade with Axel William Crypto in few weeks.	1

"It really depends on whether you are studying at a college or a university how theoretical it gets. I just completed my bachelors of computer science at a university, and basically programming is not being taught to you (just very very minimally). You are expected to do learn it yourself on your own (and everyone does so anyways). It is more a tool that you use for other courses, than what you are learning towards.
I had a lot of theoretical courses in maths, theoretical computer science (complexity theory), technical computer science (Transistors and stuff), and practical computer science (Algorithms and Datastructures). You can use your programming skills everywhere to solve tasks, and that is the beauty of it."	1

"When some people say ""games from older generations were better"" I must agree.. As a kid I imagined how insane the games would look like with so much more options to buy and play with even better graphics and physics. But sadly nowadays most titles are just cash grabs and the fun part is ignored, its hard to find triple A titles with good and fun gameplay without only pay2win features. Thats why I'm revisiting emulation, indie games and a few AAA titles which are worth the money and also the playtime."	2

Hey KRK , you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest. Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art. Yeah it's a remake but why it has made ? Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time . Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work . So guys don't take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ????	1

"I would like to argue that declaring you quit the death game and that the girlfriend can save herself is perhaps the worst way to test the game master in that situation. Yes, figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea, but if the only reason they're helping you is because they're impressed with your selflessness/willingness to risk your life to save hers/they have a connection to the girlfriend, then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game. I'm not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declaration/action, but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own ""motivations"" to see if that has any effect, but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you."	1

"First of all, let me clear up the misunderstanding about why Asians do well in life: we do not always send kids off to academic supplements, SAT study classes, etc... Obviously, there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go, but there are a plethora that do just as well, if not better on these types of activities (SAT, ACT, GPA, school, etc...) without any additional help, aside from a practise test book from the local library. That is me, and I can affirm that for many Asian kids, we have an inherent need to do good, make our parents proud (no matter how much pressure we have), and have a high-level job and go to Ivy League schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us. We push for the best because of our work ethic, not because all Asians have ""oh so much money"". For the majority of our parents, as immigrants, it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour, the hard work, the exhaustion, and the prejudice they have faced in the past, all to provide their children with more opportunities. It is not that Asians are inherently smarter, or richer, or more privileged in any ways (although there are those select few), but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today. Asians are no different from others of ethnic origin, to say: Mexicans, African-Americans, Indians, and other ""dis-privileged minorities"" in the States. The only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties. Do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end? I am not trying to start up any racial slurs, cursing, or insultations of any kind, just putting out a thought and consideration for you all. Obviously, there are many successful, talented, and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones, but I am just making a point here: Why would the high-level universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of ""racial preference"" or ""racial advantage""? Note I put that in quotations, meaning I myself do not think that is a fact. There are hard-working and lazy people, smart and ignorant, good and bad in any race, it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public. So tell me, why should one race get more ""sympathy"" or ""preference"" over another? Can we not just all be equal human beings? It is like saying ""red is better than pink!"" Why? ""Oh, because it is true!"" without an explanation. So, what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me, due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade Chinese girl, and I wanted to share the truth to everyone. Thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully, we can all start changing society little by little, with messages like this! No enmities I hope! :)"	2

"Good summation. My only disagreement is with the part where you say investors chose bbby in Jan 21 because it was highly shorted.
 My understanding is it's part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument (and all retail companies. Movie theatre, used game store, towels) and when GME went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket. I can't talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on Reddit prior to the last week of Jan 21. 
Sure, since becoming bagholders people think it's a movement but to start with it was a value play. When I went long gme was $9.18 pre split with $12 book value. When I went long bbby it was $4.98 with huge call option interest at $5 and Ryan Cohen had skin in the game. 
It's fine playing meme stocks but I suggest getting in when the chatter is low and if Ryan Cohen is involved make sure your cost basis is less than his ??"	1

The Maritime Disaster that was the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 lives on in memory still in the 21st Century. How remarkable is that really? One of the startling facts for me is that it sank in just under three hours with a loss of 1500 people. It must have been terrifying especially as it happened in the dark. One of the most eerie things I've ever watched is when scientists finally found the wreck, a great distance from where they thought it would be, they were in a mini sub and the bulk of the ship just loomed out of the darkness, it was truly weird.  I don't like deep water in fact terra firma for me thank you. Great video Neil, see you tomorrow.	0

"These are really nice clips - even though I doubt I'm really your target demographic, having spent the last thirty years working full time in bookstores. I was particularly taken with your take (sorry) on Proust. I had a very similar experience with Thomas Mann's 'The Magic Mountain'. It took me three or four goes to get through it first time round, but every time I started from the beginning again, I was finding new stuff in it I hadn't noticed before - and in the end taught myself enough German to be able to tackle it in the original. Which was hugely worthwhile, and I still go back to it regularly.
Proust is also great, but there are large chunks of it I found really, physically, stifling and claustrophobic. But if you read anything about his life story, that makes perfect sense!"	2

My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this:  42 inches or so, anti-glare, normal aspect ratio not ultra wide, but 1440 @ 200mhz instead of 4k (because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k @ 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway).

If possible, i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review:

- What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor (try playing a game in 1080/1440 and seeing what the monitor's scaling is like)
- In the settings, what HDR options are available?

Thanks!"	2

My favorite idea is a cephalopod world. In the game Splatoon, the lore is people died to a massive war and sea life took hold. It's kinda hinted their evolution was rapid due to either radiation, science gone wrong, or the lack of mammalian predators. So I wonder what a squid or octo world would be like. Would both evolve simultaneously like the Inklings and Octolings did? Would civilization rise again? I dunno, I wonder what a realistic Splatoon world would be where sealife, specifically invertebrates, evolved."	2

It may surprise some people, but logistic REGRESSION is in fact a regression model. The output is continuous: it's a probability. Of course you can dichotomize the output and create a classifier. Just like you can dichotomize any score function or regression model output. So the distinction between regression and classification is not so clear cut.	1

"Everyone's understandind of the situation is relative to their own subjective experience. It is unfair to make comparisons bewtween the past and the present without taking into account all the different variables (which is practically impossible).

It's like electricity going out and you saying ""You think that's bad!?! Ackchually humans lived without electricity for thousands of yeears!"". Of course that's a ridiculous statement because humans in the past were not nearly as dependent on electricity as we are now, and even though it may not have been important to them, to us no electricity for just a month could mean the dissolution of the world as we know it.

So please don't make ignorant comparisons between the present and the past as if things were indeed that simple."	0
"To everyone who's studying with this music:
Checklist: 

1) A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate??
2)Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time??
3)Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake anyone up??
3) A tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake(I usaully prefer coffee), green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.?
4) Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone, a few pens, paper, or whatever you need.?
5) Anything else you could need, what about a heating pad, keeping yourself warm all the time isn't bad! a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy!!! ??


Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. yup
You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.

I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight

The fact that they dont score on a curve is a completely lie and was contradicted in the video. What do u call saying that one test is harder than another  so they can get more wrong. Even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating. This is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar. And even though this may be harder for the English section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a CURVE because there is no other word for what ur doing.	0

There is always a risk associated with starting a business - I agree with this! That's the reality, not all of the businesses are most likely to succeed, but it is always up to us whether to persevere for another day or to just give up. It is important to build a business you are passionate and compassionate to continue every day. Don't forget to invest in your knowledge and your business' improvement, rather than on growing profits alone.	2

"No sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular! I saw this opening night in IMAX and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life. The sound of the jets flying by, the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the G forces kick in, and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots. I legitimately believed during the final dogfight that Maverick was going to die, so few movies today make me believe that!

On top of all that, the story is so freaking amazing. The theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones, the story of Rooster learning to not just forgive Maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and dont think just fly. And of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when Maverick visits Iceman. Even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance.????????

"*SOME PEOPLE STILL ASK, ""WHY ARE THERE STILL APES (OR MONKEYS)?""*
It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works. Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes, and from that, due to their lack of education, they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans. That is not how evolution works, but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology. 

They might just as well have asked ""If dogs are descended from wolves, why are there still wolves?"" Or even ""If Americans came from Europe, why are there still Europeans?"" Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves, so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes. 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys. Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches, apes evolved the ability to swing, arm over arm, from branch to branch. Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment. For apes, that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it. At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests.

Had environmental conditions remained the same, we would still see forests covering the whole African continent. However, conditions did not stay the same; the climate became drier. As a result, forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands, the African savanna, with just a few scattered trees. The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct.

Then, about 6 or 7 million years ago, one population of apes split, with some of them opting for life on that open savanna. All apes are capable of walking upright, they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time.  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them, walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking. Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly.

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity. by about 4 mya, our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis, femur, knees and feet as modern humans. That gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel. They did however, retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened.

The apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change. They became the ancestors of today's chimps and bonobos. Those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes, and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them. It set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us."	0

moral of the story is be cheap, learn a skill from that cheapness and capitalize on that, in my first week i made more than in a month at previous jobs ive had throughout high school and ive actually been able to enjoy it, learn things while making
money, and look at all of my work and feel fulfilled and happy unlike any of my other jobs"	2

"My theory here:

- That ""plant creature"" could possibly be that Fungus but in a more mutated form. As seen previously in the ""Missing Persons"" and  ""Autopsy Report"" videos, whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, they get covered in this black coloured fungus. This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto (mutating itself onto the dead body). Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate (100, 1000 or even millions of years at best) and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the ""Informational"" video with the date 2/9/1990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished, however it wasn't teleportation but instead time travel. That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the ""Presentation"" video with the date 5/8/1990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async. So by this logic, the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms, the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time. The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash. As seen in Kane's secret video of ""9780415263573"", this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed, the driver wasn't able to push the brakes in time to stop the car. Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage. The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there. The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in it's mutated form. Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out ""Help"" in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room (which was seen in the ""original found footage"" video and later the ""Pitfalls"" video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of it's last victims and in this case, even it's originator which is the driver). It's all just a theory which I just came up with. Don't take it canon lol."	0
Im 12 as well and i was inspired to start my own business by these tiktoks, I started painting custom ordered seashells :) Im so happy with how my business turned out :D all I did to figure out what I was going to sell is I went around my room five times with my eyes closed and what ever my finger landed on I sold and it landed on a seashell and thats how my business started, I would really recommend starting your own business as a past time! :) its also a great way to earn money and allowance as a kid and its so fun to do I really enjoy it it can be stressful at times but its so worth it :D	2

I've just recently watched the original but I've to say that this teaser actually looks really good. I'm not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but I've high hopes from this film because it's the same duo who directed the original one. Personally, I don't have any problems from a remake and I don't think remaking something is a crime. The remake, however, has to be good. If it doesn't justify the acting of the original actors then it's a crime otherwise if it's a remake like Kabir Singh (which is a really good remake) then I don't have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good	2

"I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us. If the book we're reading doesn't wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief. 
This quote by Kafka perfectly illustrates why we need books to challenge and disrupt us cerebrally. If were reading only for entertainment, where else in our lives are we finding that sector of learning and stimulation that phenomenal books provide us with?"	1

"Having done a lot of diving - I can say that the octopus is an absolute marvel to encounter. Some (mostly the younger ones) are ... So curious. At first it's like ""WOW! U THREAT?!"" once it establishes that you are not, it's like ""Eeer ... What are you then? I've never seen one of you around before."" and there begins the act of mutual curiosity :3. You slowly reach with a finger, it sends a tentacle ... you both touch, sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand, flashing black before letting go, but not swimming away. They are playful, find a shiny pebble, hand it to the octopus, it'll take it, check if it can be eaten ... discard it ... then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to ""why did he give me this pebble ... gotta check again for anything special"". They really hold a very special place in my heart, it's not everyday that two species get curious about one another and attempt mutual understanding :)"	2

"Right, when I got into my first CS class in college I was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages, but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a 10 line program in C++ for two days, and never did any other programming.

That first CS class made me hate CS. Because the material was way too quick. I started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph, and then it got too overwhelming since I was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week. I didnt have enough time so I stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because I was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses. I understood how they worked, but not at all their applications.

My advice: read the textbook briefly and dont read every word, so that you wont become overwhelmed and stop reading all together."	0

"In WW2, when the Americans liberated the concentration camp ""Saint-Cyprien"", located in France. The American troops wanted to feed the newly freed Camp Prisoners because they have been starving. 

Without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food, literally seconds after liberating them. The soldiers, thinking it was the right thing, started giving the Prisoners Apples, Sandwiches, and even Chocolates. 
Leading to a lot of Prisoners dying.

After that incident, the Science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the Medical Staff feed them first.

Hi Marko! I'm living in the Germany (not born though) and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis.  Honestly, as a european, I feel quite disappointed by everything. I understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after Fukushima accident, but on the other hand I cannot understand how they didn't invest in other resources, or should I say how the Europe, especially Germany didn't diversify when it comes to energy suppliers. It's like you said, they just ignored that fact, even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with Russia.	0

First of all, as someone that has played chess for close to 20 years (on and off), I am impressed with the results that Michelle made in a short time. Chess is a game that you have to play for months at the very least to become good at. It takes time to recognize patterns and then feel comfortable enough playing against someone else that has also been playing for a while. You did great Michelle :)	2

I agree to some points but disagree to some, I don't think studying Data Science  and knowledge gained will be worthless in 5-10 years. The core statistics and maths learned in the degree will be useful decades to come. Yes some aspects of tech stack will change but the same thing happens in other computer science fields as well. The Data Science is very broad field and if one does degree in this field they can transfer those skills into multitude of other fields and can create value for the company and lastly career trajectory in this field is still not fixed as this is nascent field and we don't know how things will pan out in 10-20 years down the line.	1

"A number of years ago McD did a limited ""Global Menu"" thing where they brought a few of their international exclusives to the US. I think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that I remember was a burger from Spain and a Stroopwafel McFlurry from the Netherlands. I don't remember trying the Spanish burger, it really wasn't anything that different. The Stroopwafel McFlurry was awesome tho, was sad to see it go. Anyway, I knew a little bit about the Japanese exclusive items, and was hopeful they'd continue it and do a run with a few of those here, the McTeriyaki Burger sounds awesome, and I'm surprised they haven't tried the McFloats here. Ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the US and it would be so easy. A Dr Pepper McFloat would be really good for US taste. I'm also kind of upset they ditched the Snack Wraps, probably a US exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around. They had 3 that I remember, Big Mac, a barbecue crispy chicken one, and I think a bacon ranch one (?) wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito. I think you got 2 per order, and They were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if that's what one was hungry for on the go."	2

It has been eight years since this video was uploaded. I watched it for the first time about four or five years ago, when I was in high school. I prepared for the biology exam by these videos.

I'm already finishing the third year and I teach biology scholars who, like myself some time ago, are about to enroll a med university. This is awesome. Thank you, Hank, and thanks to all of the CrashCourse team for this truly the greatest course of biology ever made.	2

Education is discipline. If you know its important although you just have to go through with it, youll definitely go places. On the other hand... there are many who think they wont learn a thing there. These are the people who cant work except dreaming about doing the next big thing, because of their lack of discipline.	1

"Even after practicing more than 1600 questions till now, I'm not able to cross the 1300 barrier; I have given 5 practice tests till today and my scores are : 1350, 1310, 1250, 1310 and 1320. What could be the probable reason according to you? Please help. I really feel frustrated and hopeless now to think that even after practicing so many questions I'm not able to get a 1400+ score.

Edit : I've given one attempt and my score was 1310"	0

It sucks how theyve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters ?? Spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly, like you said, these new characters lack any character growth and as such, I dont feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable. I just dont care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters. Also I just discovered your channel and I love your content ??	0
"Thanks for the video Sundas!  I still struggle to know what data science role I want to do. I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on picking direction when you don't yet have experience. There's a big gap between the skills I have now and some of the positions I am interested, but I'm hoping that I can still move around in the field as I learn more.
My data science journey started last year during the pandemic when I was locked out of my PhD lab and needed to do something productive.
My process so far
1. Data Science in R series from Harvard on Edx
2. Reading practical statistics for data science with a bookclub
3. Python programming course
Pre4. Learned some linear algebra, calculus 
4a. ML course
4b. Data science fellowship with DS4A
Now. Learning SQL online!
Always. Engage in DS community and attend talks to learn about various topics
Next. Applied Machine learning class to do some project work and also I should  finish my PhD this semester!!"	2

I just graduated from law school and attended Washington U in St. Louis for my undergrad. It is so interesting seeing all of these people a few years behind me talk about stats, scores, and extracurriculars. Yale and other elite schools can really and truly set you up for life. But just remember, if your scores arent this amazing or you dont get into your dream school, you still have a wonderful life ahead of you. Ive taken classes at community college, public universities and private universities, and your education really is what you make of it. College is only a few years out of the rest of your life, and I wish in high school I had known that and spent more time making memories and less time worried about my GPA. Just my two cents, and amazing that all of these students are so accomplished at such young ages!	2

"Four principles of technical communication: 
1. Start at the right point (From Known to Unknown) - ""show of hands"" - err on the side of caution
2. Don't go too far into the rabbit hole - explain 3 things that pique interest rather than a whole load of information
3. Clarity is better than Accuracy - iron out the finer details later
4. Explain why it is ""cool"" - enthusiasm is key 

Most importantly, convey ""It is not about whether you are good or bad at it, it is all about being interested in it!"""	2

"On the first point: I had been coding since 7th grade and I had plenty of classmates who hadn't coded ever when I started college. For those of you in the latter position, we don't judge your for not knowing programming. We are glad you are trying to learn and many of us want to help you! I love inviting friends over to my dorm and helping them out with assignments and group studying. You don't need to be scared of us or embarrassed that you aren't a flawless coder, we aren't either and the skill we have we had to put in work for as well, and we want to help you get to that point as well! We're all at school to learn, and if I can help others I will, I hope once I get to upper division classes that those friends will help me as well when they inevitably get to a point where they are better than me at certain things! You can't be the best at everything

Also for the book thing, as a math major (double majoring), I have a nagging need to buy every book for every class. They are expensive, but it fills me with pure joy to have a library of math and CS textbooks in my room. I am willing to skip on a game or two for a textbook, both provide me with entertainment because I am weird lol"	2

"Exactly! As a member of GenX, a lot of us are still paying off our loans but yet are gonna send our kids to do the same thing 20+ years later? I think not. I say this as a person with a bachelor's and masters degree! I encourage young people to get as much education for free or as cheaply as they can. The important thing is OUTPUT. If you produce good work, academic or otherwise, you'll always be in demand. 

With the internet, people are able to start ALL sorts of income producing ventures without high overhead. You can become a software programmer using tutorials online  and make plenty of money. You can learn a trade with only two years of study via community college. If you've got the mind to start your own company afterwards, THEN get a business degree when you're able to pay as you go. You can learn digital marketing without a degree."	2

I appreciated this so much. The problem I'm having is knowing where to focus. I am a jack of all trades when it comes to most things I do and I feel so overwhelmed looking at job descriptions that require different skills all relating to computer science. There have been a couple things that I really enjoyed, but they didn't relate to coding as much which makes me question if this was right for me. All I can do is continue practicing in areas that interest me and look for a job that asks for that.	2

I thought the content and editing of this docu was really very good. Let down, however, once again, by an agonising and overly intrusive soundtrack of bings, bongs, muzak and mood noise that was so distracting it was actually fighting the content for my attention. Please, please dispense with this nonsense. Or offer a noise pollution free variant. It is such a problem in shows such as this. Horizon in the UK is especially bad.	0

"This story should also be a story of Boris Spassky. If the information is correct, the guy is a really decent person. Spassky could, repeat, could be a world champ without competing, but no. When Fischer had his ""ticks"", Spassky said just give in, and let's play. Many years later Spassky told then US-president Bush to ""Free Spassky"", and even met Fischer in prison to play chess

Boris Spassky was obvisously one of a kind. A human face of communism"	1

The best part about the teaser is that both Hrithik and Saif look drastically different from R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi. And very honestly, Hrithik's Vedha is looking slightly more menacing than Vijay's. I'm cautious but highly excited at the same time ??????I'm quite hopeful towards this movie coz the directors of the original have made this as well and if I'm not wrong they've said it ISN'T a scene to scene remake Hopefully optimistic ????	2

Im a refrigeration technician, and I realized a while back that the water evaporates out of the bottoms of the leaves to refrigerate them, when water evaporates, the vapor pulls heat from the remaining source water, cooling it. This is necessary because sunlight has the potential to heat the leaves beyond the temperature they can still function for photosynthesis.	1

What a gift! Relating the great literary masters to educate and dymistify financial matters....wow...what a gift. Thanks Lewis and Professor Mihir Desai for another drop in the ocean moment.

"So I took the SAT practice test 10 right... I usually score 1360-1400 on a practice test. I make a total of 5 mistakes on the math section on a bad day, which is what happend. Usually it will translate to a score of 730-740. I did pretty well on reading (33/52) and writing (40/44) sections. I'm excited to calculate my score and then... I see the horrific truth:
40/44 in writing is translated to 330 (70 points deducted for 4 wrong answers).
33/52 is translated to 280 (Fine).
53/58 is translated to 710 (90 points deducted for 5 wrong answers). 
A total of 1320. Even though I did exteramly good in the writing section, just above averge in reading (which is a totally flawed section but that's another topic), and amazing in the math section I got a just above average score that gives me no chance hypothetically to get into my dream school.

I worked at GameStop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs Ive seen. The first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in; its common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out. I bet its missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because its been resurfaced in some way. The second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes. With these consoles, very little is done before theyre repackaged and sold.	0

As a former combat planner in Vietnam, I agree with General Hodges. Putin's 'attrition' strategy is not well thought out. Firstly, they don't have the right equipment, manpower or time. Ukraine has all of that except for 'equipment' in sufficient quantities. Over time, the West's resources will help Ukraine fill that gap.	0

I once had a question, how the regressor would look like without any coeffecient except the intercept in a linear regression. Could not answer it right away, but got the to the answer after a couple of mins. I asked the job interviewer if anyone ever got it right after immediteatly and he said only one, but he did not hire him. So don't worry question aren't everything, its got more to do with the way you handle the situation with dignity and without being a liar.  Also keep your head up, iwrote hundred of applications and still ended up at a big corp.	1
Wow, that was a great explanation. I feel like I understand why some molecules are polar and others are not. Also at the end you mentioned that protons and electrons are actually waves.

It's so important that people like you come up with such good content in order to teach folks that data science is not just about programming language and applying random ML libraries to get >90% efficiency.

The problem is it's not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the Mario kart tracks for example.

Big mistake!  I own both the X Box Series X and PS 5 and alot of the older games from previous gen releases run and look alot better on the X Box Series X.  Even some of the current gen titles look better on X Box Series X.

Twenty years ago I gave a small talk about VARK to my fellow educators. The key point in my plenary was that learning styles are not separate, but complement each other in a holistic manner. Over 47 years I have found many 'keys' to assisting students to learn : humour, comfort (having eaten, slept well, etc.) pause frequently to review points, question your own knowledge openly and invite students to do the same as they learn. I loved teaching and was only persuaded to finish when the paperwork before AND after took more time than the educating.	2

Excellent video. I appreciate all your research.The victorian era is very fascinating to me. I especially like the mystery or adventure books of the era. My favorite are Doyle, Stevenson, Verne, Melville, Wilkie Collins, and Kipling (though not his more imperialist stuff) .

"Amazing lecture Suzie and excellent way of taking a stand on the nature of science and how we have used it and how we should use it. You could have even talked more about the scientist+civilians ""sacrificing"" or loosing their lives after doing experiences with new inventions etc. Many lives were lost due the lack of safety issues back in the days or just due to not knowing all the side effects etc. Excellent job Suzie. I am very amazed by your work and by your wisdom."	2

"Excellent repair.  

I few years back, I did a repair on a computer with a broken SATA port.  i replaced the port and the system ran fine.  A year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasn't working.  I'm like 'okay'.  I asked did he want data recover service.  He said it was working fine and that I was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something I'd done.  I keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders.  I said to him that his system didn't even have an HDD in it when it was repaired and only had one SSD in it.  He mumbled something and said he'd just take his business elsewhere.

I know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists.  But I have a serious question to people who'd just be regular customers.  If you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem, would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free?  I'm hoping this question doesn't come out as snarky or sarcastic.  It's a sincere question I'd like to have answered."	1
I think the word bonus is maybe the wrong word that Voyager is using. I interpreted it to mean they want to offer a retention incentive to keep those they cant replace and they need to keep operations going smoothly. In healthcare, these types of bonuses are offered quite often to retain much needed staff. In the long run the cost is well worth it.	1

"It seems to me that the purpose of life is to contribute to Society, and do good things. And the purpose of education is to learn how to interpret and understand the World.

"Her dad was being sarcastic (in the most compassionate way) when she brought him seaweed sushi from the expensive restaurant. Like, she had the option to bring him literally anything else from a place that's 300K per meal, and she brings something similar to what he spends all day making. It's like bringing a sandwich shop owner a sandwich with fancier ingredients. 

But from Woo Young Woo's perspective, gimbap/seaweed sushi is her favorite thing, so it was a gift of love for her dad."	2

""this is the only thing that's academically important to do that is *secluded* from school. meaning that there are *no teachers or classmates* to hinder/interrupt your learning. THIS TEST IS 100% THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT YOU PUT IN!""
so that's just really something to think about while you're going into this test. i wish you all the best <3"	2
"I'm a Computer Engineering student going to 2nd year now. So far we have tackled Computer System Servicing, Programming(C++ & Java), and other minor and major engineering subjects. I have no experience with programming, but I was able to do just fine. Calculus was the only hard subject I took so far, which is offered in every engineering courses. 

We are going to tackle more about electronics, robotics, and computer architecture in the higher years.

So if you're feeling to take Computer Engineering, go ahead, it's a good degree."	2

On my channel are a series of ion propelled aircrafts that are patented specifically for lifting their power supplies against Earth's gravity.  They can fly with no moving mechanical parts.  They create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards.  They don't defy physics though, rather they rely on well-known physics.  It used to be that ion propulsion could not lift its power supply from the ground. There are more than 40 public videos of the craft."	2

"These people are not high school students. They have forgotten some stuff. 
Even then, the 670 average is a lot higher than the national average of 528 as you have claimed. This is more than 1 standard deviation from the mean, and almost 2 standard deviations. I would think this concludes that Chinese people are on average, good in SAT Maths, instead of looking at a fixed cut-off score of 700 and concluding that they are not that good."	0

"G.E.M.S. Report:

""Out of Order.

Animatronics: W1. Freddy, W3. Chica, T1. Freddy, T4. Mangle, T5. BB has been deemed unfit for interview procedures.

Do not attempt to engage.
Subjects may become hostile.

- G.E.M.S.""

G.E.M.S. Facility within the last 12 hours has experienced multiple breaches concerning containment. List including:
- Withered
- Plastic(s)
- Nightmare(s)

Individual subjects include:
- William Afton (Springtrap)
- Marionette (Contained within 'Lefty')
- Amalgamation ('Ennard')
- Golden Freddy (???)
- Balloon Boy

At approximately [REDACTED] an explosion was witnessed/detected within the G.E.M.S. Facility. Currently we're investigating the whereabouts of the missing subjects. Updates will be posted IF evidence is found.

; At [REDACTED] in a heavily wooded area, leading towards the G.E.M.S. Facility, a member of G.E.M.S. personnel was compromised by the Amalgam. A G.E.M.S. helicopter was seen erupting in flames and falling quickly.

Recovery of Springtrap was unsuccessful, and subjects were lost.

We've assembled a Squadron consisting of: AMETHYST, OPAL, EMERALD, RUBY; We infiltrated an abandoned building, the Squadron were observed watching a music box play consisting of the main three Freddy Fazbear entertainment bots.

The footage on display was then engulfed within static, the Squadron sent was now deemed compromised.

This is extremely true. One example: My brother is amazing at art. He's super talented, but he keeps getting Cs and Ds in art because he doesn't do what hes told. He challenges the teachers.

I< think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION! so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs. Great points in your video. I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to S&P/Nasdaq and Altcoins to BTC. Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective. So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom. That short term thinking is such a rookie mistake. By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out. Next bull run it won't be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k. What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low. I'm really holding on for this possible low point reentry, I screwed up some time back & i need this lower point to get back in, i've small cash on the sideline I don't like that but i refuse to fomo in. Our younger investors are scared, they're concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before. My advise to them is this, go all out into trading. Trading is where the bucks are been made. I see the stock market, housing values going down, and crypto going up. Traditional markets are getting recked. The new economy is crypto, not fiat. People want truth, not corruption, contracts not monetary easing. Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mrs. Robin Moore.

I'm beginning to understand chess is really like an ocean in complexity. There's place of brashness, boldness, creativity, fear, light touch, nimbleness, anger, bluffs.

"Notes:
-All the information youll need will be on the test, whether its in the passage or the little introduction brief
-Before reading the passage, skim the questions to see if therere any summary/theme questions, and take note of the vocab words
-Remember to read the title/little introduction
-For vocab questions, read the whole sentence, plus maybe the sentences before and after for context. Then substitute in each answer
-Know what certain terms are (7:04)

For two-part questions:
-Look at the second part and highlight all the quotes in the passage
-Then read the first question (only the question) and try to see which quote answers every part of the question
-Compare the quote to the first questions answers

For the literature passage:
-Try to be engaged/to have fun
-Read challenging books beforehand

For the debate passages:
-Read the first passage and answer all the passage-1-specific questions while its still fresh in your mind
-Repeat for passage 2

-Especially for the Science-based passages, dont infer anything. Use the passage/graphs to back up each answer"	1

This still makes the aliens too primitive and human like. More than likely they'd just turn everything off like a giant emp, and use some sort of frequency that affects our nervous system, knocking us out, then they come down to collect what they want or to take over. Is it exciting, full of action, giving the humans a chance to take a stand? No, but it's more efficient and something an advanced species would do.	0

"Unfortunately Google has no clue how to measure ""helpful."" I can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top. The economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around Google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled.  Google could simply remove the top N content farms to improve search results.  Look at the fake DIY and cooking sites on YouTube. Google could push them to the bottom, yet they are often pushed to the top. 

Content farms have high production value and low value content, but users will go first for slick looking.  And the kicker, Google generates revenue from ads on those pages. Put simply, incentives are not aligned for Google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content.

Edit: Not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric.  Apply that idea to getting a mortgage, getting medical advice, hiring a contractor,...  If someone tells me fertilzer X-Y-Z is best for my tomatoes, you know what I'm going to do."	0

I cannot imagine any television networks making these sort of programs these days. It is rather depressing, because 1980's is rather recent for some of us.

In retrospect 1980s may have been the last era in which high culture would have any part to play in television.	0

"As someone who's from MD and lives in PA - Pennsylvania came higher than I expected and Maryland was lower. Baltimore probably dragged Maryland down, but PA is a surprise. That's because Pennsylvania schools are funded through a system called ""school taxes"", where each of the 500 school districts (spread across 67 counties) levy their own property taxes to fund their schools. That's why someone living next door to you can be paying twice as much in taxes to go to a school half as good. This system has been known to disproportionately affect rural and urban school districts and tip in favor of school districts in suburban communities, or those in the Poconos where they have resorts that people own condos at."	0

"Truly a remarkable presentation!! I read probably my most highly inspirational book by my newfound role model, Fundamentals: The Ten Keys to Reality by Frank Wilczek who he references experiments as well as other interesting findings in this presentation. Theres also the book, QED The Strange Theory of Light and Matter by Richard P. Feynman which this video helps me visualize the x-rays excitements.

These all ultimately lead me to a sense of motivation and question as to whats left to discover?

Well I position myself towards LIGO Virgo KAGRA into understanding gravity and gravitational waves.

Of course education follows, but for now I am currently reading a booklet called Relativity the 100th anniversary; as instructed I have not proceeded further until I am fully convinced on the requirement needed in chapter 8.

"Has there ever been any speculative evolution of the octopus? I would very much like to see that! Since there have already been xenobiologists who have described the rise of octopus since they have massive amounts of neurons (e.g. throughout the animal, including each leg, which has the ability to feel, taste and smell) it is known that they have a great degree of intelligence from using that different type of ""brain."" They already have their own video channels such as 'Octolab' etc, but I remember someone showing drawings of octos swinging through trees.

"These next gen consoles should've shipped with more storage to begin with (especially considering they're backwards compatible with last gen). But atleast Xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device.

If you don't mind moving games. I'd suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive (like the Sandisk Ultra Fit). You can easily fit 2 on the back USB ports on the Xbox giving up to 1TB of more storage. While still having room the expandable SDD too. Plus you can play the older Xbox One games off the flashdrive.

Sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive. However using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space. Meaning it's easier to fit in an entertainment center. Plus it makes it easier if you move your console often."	2

You're right, you don't have to study the knowledge you accumulated from 9th to 11-12th grade.

This video tells about the diversity of Indonesian culture. it introduces about, traditional songs, traditional clothes, traditional musical instruments, and animals from Indonesia.

A princess is symbolized as ""ibu pertiwi"" (Nusantara), the 1-headed dragon is symbolized ""patih Gajahmada"" which unites many tribes together. 8 birds symbolize the 8 major islands in Indonesia, namely Papua Island (785.753 km2) Kalimantan Island (748.168 km2) Sumatra Island (473.481 km2) Sulawesi Island (180.681 km2) Java Island (138.794 km2) Timor Island (28.418 km2) Halmahera Island (18.040 km2 ) and Seram island (17.454 km2), the 2-headed dragon is symbolized as the 2 countries that once colonized Indonesia (the Netherlands and Japan), defeated by the trident which symbolizes the 3 independence figures, they are Ir.

I havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now. The gaming industry has changed for a while now, and its only getting worse. I buy 3~4 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted. Quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays, CoD and Battlefield lost their way. Quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy GoTY editions usually and often second hand (gotta love disc edition systems). I refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers.	0

Pragg continuing to be the comeback king!! Amazing play, he made this tournament extremely exciting, was just glued to all his games. And Magnus also played really well at the start but I lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely. He couldn't even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested. The least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because Magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so it's not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him, rlly left a bitter taste but I'm soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament, he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring.	2

I'd much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue, but also related past issues as well as potential future ones.

And I should also have mentioned interpreters along with compilers as this is an important concept, especially having coded a fair amount of python I have no excuses. I added a couple of notes in the video description.

Thanks for pointing these omissions out, and thanks for all the words of encouragement as well. I was trying something new with the graphic design on this one, trying to match the look to the subject matter and I think it worked out well."	2
"Ever wonder just how accurate the 'experts' are in telling us what happened?  I mean, these are the same 'experts' who also said Troy was a myth, and didn't actually exist - yet some 'crack pot' proved them wrong.  A rather normal situation where 'experts' do everything they can to disprove anyone who tries to disprove what those 'experts' built their lives upon.  
Still think more appropriate title would be 'Myth vs. Evidence based guess'.  Still, history is captivating and gives us a peek into what may have happened in the past, as well as how civilization continues to repeat history."	1

  Breathe. This test doesn't define you. You'll do great. Stop scrolling through the comments, get back to working. You can do this. Have the mental breakdown later and make a meme out of it. You'll be fine."	2
"I was 6 years old and would spend hours watching my brothers play Skyrim, cod Black ops 2 multiplayer/zombies,  prince of Persia, Minecraft, Batman, dead space.

Black ops 2 holds a very special place in my heart, even tho I never really got to play those games just watching my brothers play em was fun enough for me, I would do anything to go back to those day's, to get excited whenever I heard the Xbox start up sound, even tho I couldn't play games till I was older just watching my brothers gaming adventures and playing online with my other brothers, that was fun enough for me.


Brings back Alot of nostalgic memories."	2

"Data science is extremely saturated at entry level, just ask anybody who's applied for a data science job in the last year. Moreover, data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data, but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost. If you actually want to work on AI projects these days and not just be a data analyst you'll need a PhD in computer science. 

Also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering. As data science tools continue to be democratized and automated, software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills, as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role, so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part."	1

My literature teacher told us to come here. I now understand why and that literature goes beyond being entertained by a book or for the sake of pleasure. I now see reading is a 'tool' that will help us in our lives, experiences, feelings (good or bad ones but still feelings) and so much more but it would be a very long list.

Thanks for sharing! The study like its your last test even though youre taking it twice is an interesting approach. I get the value in it but I actually say the opposite to my students because they get so stressed out. I tell them not to worry and just relax in there because they can always take it again! Also the focus on the math first I like - Ill actually have them only do one portion of the test with me for the whole month or two and then take the test and then do the other portion for a whole month or two to SuperScore	2

I sold my Xbox One X a few months ago (on eBay), and whew... this video makes it seem like I really sold mine for far, far too cheap!  I'm one of those people that keeps everything -- including the foam wrap, plastic bags, and twist ties -- so the console looks pretty darn good once I get it all back together.  I can imagine that the only reason you'd want to buy from Gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong, and familiarity.  Also, they don't know me, but they know Gamestop.	2

I think I'd like more deformable terrain (breaking glass, environments affected by weather systems, world changes that aren't static and that change etc) and improved methods of moving (like verticality rather than just WASD). It feels like more fidelity comes at the expense of exploring deeper game modes. IMHO.	1

"I've taught the A-levels (UK) and the Florida/Michigan curriculum at international schools. The US has a lot less focus than the UK. Americans are confused about what ""raising standards"" really entails. Foreign curriculum pushes students to master a smaller set of skills with smaller textbooks and more essay writing whereas the US focuses on a wider range of concepts with superficial multiple choice polling. Often this leads to foreign students having mastery and being well spoken about foundational concepts while American students win trivia night but can't really explain why the know something."	1

Thank you for the video. I am currently applying to Ph.D. programs in literature, but I have a big question that I've been too afraid to ask anyone: For what purpose do we analyze literature? What concrete impact do we have on the world? Engineers build structures and innovate commodities that hopefully make our lives better. Accountants and economists impact financial situations. I'm serious: What do we do? Teach? Write books? Change hearts? Ideas?	1

## Key Deliverables  
a) Dashboard-  This is an effective method for data visualization.  This helps stakeholders understand 
and leverage business intelligence to make more informed decisions 

b) Word Cloud- The word cloud is developed to understand the most frequently used tags in the 
comment section.  This helps to understand the audience perspective of the video and accordingly 
taken some actions for the future. 

c) Popularity Score Generator- The is a score generated based on number of likes, comments, and views. 
A popularity score is going to be generated for every video using mathematical model such as AHP/ 
TOPSIS  

d) ARIMA Univariant Times Series model- This â€˜Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average' machine 
learning model is useful to predict the future popularity score of each category 

e)  Classification model for Sentiment Analysis- This supervised machine learning model is useful for 
predicting the sentiment of the viewers using the existing data collected.  The viewer sentiment is 
classified into negative, neutral and positive 

f) Clustering model- This unsupervised machine learning model is built to cluster the tags to help 
identify similar patterns or groups and thereby achieve some actionable insights.
